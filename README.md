#Ocarina of Time Practice Mods

This repository is something I'm working on for two reasons. The first is that I want to continue learning how to code and problem solve, and the second is that Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games of all time and I want to make my own personal definitive version that maximizes its strengths while minimizing its weaknesses. I feel that working on something that I genuinely care about will make it easier to press on even when I get stressed or frustrated with things.

Full disclaimer, this project is based on several preexisting projects, using them as a foundation upon which I'm making my changes. For details about the original projects read the old-read-me.md files.

The folder update-notes contains detailed notes for each update going over the changes and a summary of the process behind it. I also put [BLZ231] in all of the places where I made changes to the code for future reference.

My goal is to explore and learn how different things work together, and how to figure out how to make the changes to a program that I want and avoid making changes I don't want.

I also plan to implement new ideas and changes over time, though in general I will try to start with simpler alterations and gradually work my way up to more complicated ones. While I do have an informal list of changes I want to make, I don't have a particular order in mind, so what I work on over time might be somewhat random, though I will try to make it at least somewhat organized and logical.

This project is personal practice and is not intended for production use.
