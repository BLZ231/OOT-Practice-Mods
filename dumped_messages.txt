I'm [Color RED]Navi [Color LIGHTBLUE]the fairy![Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]The Great Deku Tree asked
me to be your [Color RED]partner [Color LIGHTBLUE]from
now on! Nice to meet you![Color DEFAULT]

0x1001
Yahoo! Hi, !

0x1002
Wow! A fairy!!Finally, a fairy came to you,
!

0x1003
I'll wait for you here.
Get going! Go see the Great 
Deku Tree!

0x1004
[Color BLUE] [Color DEFAULT]by the stone, pick it up!
[Color BLUE] [Color DEFAULT]by the stone, pick it up!Mean old[Color RED] Mido[Color DEFAULT]...he made me pick 
up the rocks in front of his house.

0x1005
Oh, you have a [Color LIGHTBLUE]fairy[Color DEFAULT] now?!
That's great, !What?You've been called by the
[Color RED]Great Deku Tree[Color DEFAULT]? What an honor!He may give you a special gift!
Tee hee!That's because the Great Deku 
Tree is our father, the forest
guardian, and he gave life to all 
of us Kokiri!

0x1006
I wonder if the [Color RED]Great Deku Tree [Color DEFAULT]
gave life to everything in the
forest, I mean in addition to us 
Kokiri?

0x1007
Hey, let's work on some moves!To [Color RED]jump sideways [Color DEFAULT]while [Color LIGHTBLUE] 
Targeting[Color DEFAULT], press [Color BLUE] [Color DEFAULT]as you move
right or left.To do a [Color RED]backflip[Color DEFAULT] while [Color LIGHTBLUE] 
Targeting[Color DEFAULT], press [Color BLUE] [Color DEFAULT]as you move
backwards.To do a [Color RED]roll attack[Color DEFAULT] while [Color LIGHTBLUE] 
Targeting[Color DEFAULT], press [Color BLUE] [Color DEFAULT]as you move
forward. While you roll, you can
avoid damage.If you have your sword ready while
[Color LIGHTBLUE] Targeting[Color DEFAULT], you can do a [Color RED]jump 
attack[Color DEFAULT] by pressing [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT]! A jump 
attack does double damage!You can use [Color LIGHTBLUE] Targeting [Color DEFAULT]on the
[Color RED]stone[Color DEFAULT] next to me, so let's 
practice!

0x1008
You're not allowed to leave the 
forest!

0x1009
The Great Deku Tree said that if
a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or 
she will die!

0x100A
That meanie,[Color RED] Mido[Color DEFAULT], made me cut 
the grass at Saria's house.Mido told Saria he would do it so
she would like him, but I'm the one
doing all the work!

0x100B
You and [Color RED]Saria[Color DEFAULT] are close friends,
so will you help me cut the 
grass?I'll let you keep anything that 
you find while cutting it.

0x100C
Yes, yes! That's how you use a
[Color LIGHTBLUE]fairy[Color DEFAULT]!It's so great that you finally have
a fairy[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]partner!I'll teach you how to talk to 
people using your fairy!

0x100D
When a fairy flies near a person 
or thing, press [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT] to [Color RED]look [Color DEFAULT]in that
direction.If you use [Color LIGHTBLUE] Targeting[Color DEFAULT], you can 
talk to people from a distance, 
like we're doing now.When you have nothing that you
can target, you can press [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT] just
to [Color RED]look forward[Color DEFAULT].
Try it!

0x100E
Oh, a [Color LIGHTBLUE]fairy [Color DEFAULT]finally came to you!Now you have a lot to learn!

0x100F
Wow! That's great news!
I'm so happy for you!Now you're a true Kokiri,
!

0x1010
Is that right? 
The Great Deku Tree has 
summoned you?It's quite an honor to talk to the
Great Deku Tree!

0x1011
Oh, you're leaving...

0x1012
But that's OK, because we'll be
friends forever...
won't we?

0x1013
I want you to have this Ocarina...
Please take good care of it.

0x1014
When you play my Ocarina, I hope
you will think of me and come
back to the forest to visit.

0x1015
Oh... Navi...
Thou hast returned......
Welcome...Listen carefully to what I, the
[Color RED]Deku Tree[Color DEFAULT], am about to tell thee...Thy slumber these past moons 
must have been restless, and
full of nightmares...As the servants of evil gain
strength, a vile climate pervades
the land and causes nightmares
to those sensitive to it...Verily, thou hast felt it...... 
The time has come to test thy
courage...

0x1016
I have been [Color RED]cursed[Color DEFAULT]...
I need you to break the curse
with your wisdom and courage.Dost thou have courage enough
to undertake this task?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x1017
Then enter, brave 
, and thou too, 
Navi...Navi the fairy...  
Thou must aid ...And ...When [Color LIGHTBLUE]Navi 
[Color DEFAULT]speaks, use [Color YELLOW] [Color DEFAULT]to listen well 
to her words of wisdom...

0x1018
Perhaps you do not yet have 
confidence in your abilities...
Return to the Kokiri Forest to
learn the skills of combat...When thou art ready, return here 
and speak with me by using [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT]...

0x1019
The best place to go to learn
some new skills is in the [Color ADJUSTABLE]Forest 
Training Center[Color DEFAULT].[Color ADJUSTABLE] [Color DEFAULT]It's on the hill
just above here.

0x101A
Ow-ow-ow! Forgive me, master!
If I give you a clue, will you let 
me go?When you jump off a high cliff,
if you hold [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT] forward, you will
roll on the ground when you land 
and won't get hurt from the fall.I can't guarantee it will
work, though, if the cliff is really,
really high, heh heh!Well, try it if you are feeling
bold!
Wah ha hah!

0x101B
Hee hee!
Under that mask...aren't you that
Kokiri kid?

0x101C
Quite an unusual mask you have
there. Hee hee! I like it! It may
make me look a little bit tougher.Hey, why don't you give it to me?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]OK
No way[Color DEFAULT]

0x101D
Doh! That's too bad for me...

0x101E
Yowza! I'm gonna wear this 
all the time!

0x101F
He just gave you [Color RED]10 Rupees[Color DEFAULT] for 
this 20-Rupee mask! You lost 
money on that deal!Go back to the Mask Shop 
and pay [Color RED]20 Rupees[Color DEFAULT] for the 
mask. The difference will have to 
come out of your own pocket.

0x1020
My buddies really want this mask!
Hee hee hee!

0x1021
Oh, you're OK? You didn't leave 
the forest after all, did you?

0x1022
Did you know that if you hold [Color LIGHTBLUE]
[Color DEFAULT]forward when you jump off a cliff,
you'll roll when you land. This will
absorb the shock of your landing.If you fall too far, though, you'll
still get hurt...

0x1023
Saria said she's waiting at the
usual spot.

0x1024
Well done, ...

0x1025
You have a cool Slingshot, huh?You know what's cool about it?
You can aim while holding down
[Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT] and shoot by releasing the
button! How cool!If you have the Slingshot ready,
you can use [Color LIGHTBLUE] Targeting[Color DEFAULT] to 
[Color RED]shoot while moving[Color DEFAULT].... Did you 
know that?

0x1026
No, ...
Thou must know my time is short...

0x1027
Now...listen carefully...
A [Color RED]wicked man of the desert[Color DEFAULT] 
cast this dreadful curse upon me...

0x1028
If you're looking for Saria, she's
in the [Color ADJUSTABLE]Lost Woods[Color DEFAULT], as usual.Don't tell me you don't know 
where that is! The entrance is up
on the cliff overlooking the 
village!I know you'll get lost! Don't 
worry, you'll just end up back at
the entrance!Harumph!

0x1029
Thou must never allow the desert 
man in black armor to lay his 
hands on the sacred Triforce...Thou must never suffer that man,
with his evil heart, to enter the 
Sacred Realm[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]of legend...That evil man who cast the death 
curse upon me and sapped my 
power...Because of that curse, my end is
nigh...Though your valiant efforts to 
break the curse were successful, 
I was doomed before you started...Yes, I will pass away soon...
But do not grieve for me...I have been able to tell you of 
these important matters...This is Hyrule's final hope...

0x102A
The future depends upon thee,
...
Thou art courageous...Navi the fairy...
Help  to carry out 
my will...I entreat ye... Navi...
Good...bye...

0x102B
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Let's go to Hyrule Castle,
!![Color DEFAULT]

0x102C
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Good-bye...[Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]Great Deku Tree...[Color DEFAULT]

0x102D
Too bad...Heh heh!

0x102E
Do you want to play some more?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x102F
Hey you! "[Color LIGHTBLUE]Mr. No Fairy[Color DEFAULT]!"
What's your business with the
Great Deku Tree?Without a fairy, you're not
even a real man!

0x1030
If you want to pass through here,
you should at least [Color BLUE]equip[Color DEFAULT] a [Color ADJUSTABLE]sword[Color RED]
[Color DEFAULT]and [Color LIGHTBLUE]shield[Color DEFAULT]!Sheesh!

0x1031
What?![Color RED]Mido [Color DEFAULT]won't let you go to see 
the Great Deku Tree?

0x1032
You can buy a [Color LIGHTBLUE]shield[Color DEFAULT] at the shop,
but there is only one [Color ADJUSTABLE]sword[Color DEFAULT]
hidden somewhere in the forest.

0x1033
If you want to see the 
Great Deku Tree, you should at 
least equip a [Color ADJUSTABLE]sword[Color DEFAULT] and [Color LIGHTBLUE]shield[Color DEFAULT]!

0x1034
I, the great Mido,[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]will never 
accept you as one of us!Shoot! How did you get to be the
favorite of Saria and the Great
Deku Tree? Huh?!
Grumble...grumble...

0x1035
I can teach you about the [Color RED]icons
[Color DEFAULT]at the top of the screen.

what action you will perform

different things you can do.

0x1038
If you want to learn about the
[Color RED]map [Color DEFAULT]and [Color RED]items[Color DEFAULT], just ask me.
But don't ask unless you want
to hear a long explanation.What do you want to know about?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]About the map

them.[Color YELLOW] Button items[Color DEFAULT] can be set to 
[Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT], [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT], and [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT], and

into the Subscreens, then press
[Color ADJUSTABLE][Color DEFAULT].

0x103C
My sister took some Rupees and 
went shopping at the store
that has a red roof.
Tee hee!Speaking of [Color RED]Rupees[Color DEFAULT], a [Color ADJUSTABLE]green [Color DEFAULT]one
is worth one, a [Color BLUE]blue[Color DEFAULT] one is worth

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x103F
If you press [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT], you can

to a top-down view. Outdoors, in
a field for example, it will switch
to a first-person perspective.Also, when "[Color YELLOW]Navi[Color DEFAULT]" is displayed in
the upper right of your screen, 
Navi the fairy wants to talk to
you. Use [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT] to listen to her!

0x1040
Well, if you play around with it, 
you'll figure it out.

0x1041
That's not quite Saria's Song...

0x1042
Mido[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]is very upset!
Did something happen to him?

0x1043
What? Where are you going?!To the castle?
Where is the castle?

0x1044
We Kokiri will die if we leave the
forest!You're not going to try to leave
the forest, are you?!

0x1045
Hey, !
What did you do?!The Great Deku Tree...did he...
die?How could you do a thing like 
that?! It's all your fault!!

0x1046
Hey!!
What are you doing in my house?!

0x1047
, you're safe!

0x1048
Saria and  will be
friends forever.

0x1049
Did something happen to the 
Great Deku Tree?

0x104A
Somehow, it seems that the air in
the forest has changed.

0x104B
, are you going
to go away?

0x104C
If you lose your shield, will
you come back?

0x104D
All of the young Deku Scrub
brothers agree...you look exactly 
like our sacred forest totem!As an offering from us, please
accept these [Color RED]Deku Sticks[Color DEFAULT].
We will also enhance your
carrying skills!Abracadabra!Alakazaaaam!

0x104E
Since the Great Deku Tree
withered...more meanies have 
been appearing in the forest...
I'm scared!

0x104F
An evil wind is blowing from the 
direction of the Forest Temple.[Color RED]Saria[Color DEFAULT] left, saying,
"I have to do something
about it!"

0x1050
The [Color ADJUSTABLE]Forest Temple [Color DEFAULT]is located 
in the Sacred Forest Meadow in
the far side of the Lost Woods.

0x1051
Saria went to the temple and 
hasn't come back...

0x1052
Hi, mister! You can't use a
Deku Shield! It's only for
kids!

0x1053
Where's Saria? 
Do you know Saria, mister?
That's weird...

0x1054
Where has [Color RED]Mido[Color DEFAULT] gone during such
an emergency?

0x1055
I see. You didn't have any 
problems entering the forest, 
mister...Did the meanies out there bother
you much? Before the Great Deku 
Tree died, you wouldn't see things
like that around here....

0x1056
Since it's dangerous outside, I 
always stay inside my house. 
But I'm bored to death in here!

0x1057
You can buy [Color RED]arrows [Color DEFAULT]at a shop 
only if you have a [Color RED]bow[Color DEFAULT]. Have you 
got one, mister?

0x1058
Have you been travelling around
much, mister?
Have you ever met a boy named 
?Mido said that the Great Deku 
Tree withered because that boy
did something wrong to it...Only Saria defended 
--until she left.

0x1059
Maybe we misunderstood....

0x105A
Haven't I seen you somewhere
before, mister?

0x105B
Mister, do you know a boy 
named ?He left the forest and never
came back...

0x105C
I wonder if  will 
ever return?

0x105D
It would be awesome to be big 
like you, mister! I really want to
be big like you!I want to be big and strong and 
beat up the Deku Scrubs, but...

0x105E
We Kokiri won't ever get bigger 
for the rest of our lives...
What a bummer!

0x105F
Why is that fairy following you 
around? You're not one of us!

0x1060
What are you? Though you wear 
Kokirish clothing, you can't
fool me!

0x1061
I promised Saria I would never
let anybody go through here.

0x1062
Hi there! I'm the [Color RED]Deku Tree 
sprout[Color DEFAULT]!Because you and Saria[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]broke the
curse on the Forest Temple, I 
can grow and flourish!Thanks a lot!

0x1063
Hey, have you seen your old
friends? None of them recognized
you with your grown-up body, did
they?That's because the [Color ADJUSTABLE]Kokiri[Color DEFAULT] never
grow up! Even after seven years,
they're still kids!

0x1064
You must be wondering why only
you have grown up!Well, as you might have already 
guessed, you are not a Kokiri!
You are actually a [Color LIGHTBLUE]Hylian[Color DEFAULT]!I am happy to finally reveal this
secret to you!

0x1065
Some time ago, before the King of
Hyrule unified this country, there
was a fierce war in our world.One day, to escape from the fires
of the war, a [Color RED]Hylian mother [Color DEFAULT]and 
her [Color RED]baby boy[Color DEFAULT] entered this 
forbidden forest.The mother was gravely injured...
Her only choice was to entrust
the child to the [Color RED]Deku Tree[Color DEFAULT], the 
guardian spirit of the forest.The Deku Tree could sense that
this was a child of destiny, whose
fate would affect the entire world,
so he took him into the forest.After the mother passed away, 
the baby was raised as a [Color ADJUSTABLE]Kokiri[Color DEFAULT].
And now, finally, the day of 
destiny has come!

0x1066
You are a [Color LIGHTBLUE]Hylian[Color DEFAULT], and were
always bound to leave this forest.And now...
You have learned your own 
destiny...
So you know what you must do...That's right...
You must save the land of 
Hyrule!Now, , break the 
curses on all of the Temples,
and return peace to Hyrule!!

0x1067
That melody?!Saria plays that song all the 
time!
You...Do you know Saria?That song...Saria taught that song only 
to her friends...

0x1068
When I see you... 
I don't know why, but I remember...
him...

0x1069
I have you now!
In this gap between dreams and 
reality, soon all that will remain
of you will be your dead body!

0x106A
Thank you...
Because of you, I could awaken as
a Sage...I am [Color ADJUSTABLE]Saria[Color DEFAULT].
The Sage of the Forest Temple...

0x106B
Saria will always be...
your friend...

0x106C
The flow of time is always cruel...
Its speed seems different for
each person, but no one can 
change it...A thing that doesn't change with
time is a memory of younger days...In order to come back here again,
play the [Color ADJUSTABLE]Minuet of Forest[Color DEFAULT].

0x106D
...
I'll see you again...

0x106E
Saria hasn't come back yet...
But I know she'll return someday...

0x106F
OK...
I trust you.

0x1070
Oh...I see...Saria won't ever come back...But...I...I made a promise to 
Saria...If  came back, I 
would be sure to tell him that 
Saria had been waiting for him...Because Saria...really...
liked...

0x1071
Hey, you.If you see him somewhere, please
let him know...

0x1072
Teach me some fancy fencing!
All I've ever done is tap [Color ADJUSTABLE] [Color DEFAULT]all
my life!

0x1073
I still think you really look like
somebody I've seen before, mister.

0x1074
You're such a big, strong guy!
I really want to be like you 
someday even though I'll always be
small.

0x1075
... I wonder if he 
will come back...

0x1076
I feel like I've known you for a
long time, mister!

0x1077
Now that the [Color RED]Deku Tree's sprout[Color DEFAULT]
is growing in the Great Deku 
Tree's meadow, the forest has
returned to normal!

0x1078
We'll all work together to protect
the forest!

0x1079
Somehow, a fair wind has begun
to blow recently.

0x107A
Since a fair wind started to 
blow, I'm sure  
will come back!

0x107B
I wonder if Saria will come back...

0x107C
I'm sure  will 
return someday!

0x107D
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Great Deku Tree...
[Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]I'm back![Color DEFAULT]

0x107E
This evil man ceaselessly uses
his vile, sorcerous powers in his
search for the Sacred Realm that
is connected to Hyrule...For it is in that Sacred Realm 
that one will find the divine
relic, the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Triforce[Color DEFAULT], which contains 
the essence of the gods...

0x107F
Before time began, before spirits
and life existed...

0x1080
Three golden goddesses descended
upon the chaos that was Hyrule...

0x1081
Din, the goddess of power...

0x1082
Nayru, the goddess of wisdom...

0x1083
Farore, the goddess of courage...

0x1084
Din...

0x1085
With her strong flaming arms, she
cultivated the land and created
the red earth.

0x1086
Nayru...

0x1087
Poured her wisdom onto the earth
and gave the spirit of law to
the world.

0x1088
Farore...

0x1089
With her rich soul, produced all
life forms who would uphold
the law.

0x108A
The three great goddesses,
their labors completed,
departed for the heavens.

0x108B
And golden sacred triangles
remained at the point where the
goddesses left the world.

0x108C
Since then, the sacred triangles
have become the basis of our
world's providence.

0x108D
And, the resting place of the
triangles has become the
Sacred Realm.

0x108E
Hey kid, you did quite well...
It looks like you may be gaining
some slight skill...But you have defeated only my
phantom...
When you fight the real me, it 
won't be so easy!What a worthless creation that 
ghost was! I will banish it to
the gap between dimensions!!

0x108F
I always believed that you would 
come. Because I know you...No...You don't have to explain
it to me...Because it is destiny that you 
and I can't live in the same world.

0x1090
I will stay here as the Forest
Sage and help you...Now, please take this 
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Medallion[Color DEFAULT]...

Thou hast verily demonstrated 
thy courage...I knew that thou wouldst be able
to carry out my wishes...

0x1092
Now, I have yet more to tell ye,
wouldst thou listen...
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x1093
...
Go now to Hyrule Castle...There, thou will surely meet
the [Color RED]Princess of Destiny[Color DEFAULT]...Take [Color RED]this stone [Color DEFAULT]with you.
The stone that man wanted so
much, that he cast the curse on
me...

0x1094
I[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]knew...
that you would leave the forest...
someday, ...Because you are different from
me[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]and my friends....

0x1095
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Hello, !
Wake up![Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]The[Color RED] Great Deku Tree [Color LIGHTBLUE]wants
to talk to you!
, get up![Color DEFAULT]

0x1096
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Hey! C'mon![Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]Can Hyrule's destiny really depend
on such a lazy boy?[Color DEFAULT]

0x1097
Jumping is going out of style now.
I'm crazy about doing [Color RED]backflips[Color DEFAULT]!
Can you do one?

0x1098
[Color LIGHTBLUE]The [Color RED]Great Deku Tree 
[Color LIGHTBLUE]has summoned you!
So let's get going, right now![Color DEFAULT]

0x1099
Navi...
Navi, where art thou?
Come hither....

0x109A
Oh, [Color LIGHTBLUE]Navi the fairy[Color DEFAULT]...
Listen to my words, the words of 
the [Color RED]Deku Tree[Color DEFAULT]...Dost thou sense it?
The climate of evil descending 
upon this realm...Malevolent forces even now are
mustering to attack our land
of Hyrule...For so long, the [Color RED]Kokiri Forest[Color DEFAULT], the
source of life, has stood as a 
barrier, deterring outsiders and 
maintaining the order of the world...But...before this tremendous evil
power, even my power is as 
nothing...It seems the time has come for 
the [Color RED]boy without a fairy [Color DEFAULT]to begin 
his journey...The youth whose destiny it is to
lead Hyrule to the path of 
justice and truth...[Color LIGHTBLUE]Navi[Color DEFAULT]...go now! Find our young
friend and guide him to me...I do not have much time left.Fly, Navi, fly! The fate of the
forest, nay, the world, depends
upon thee!

0x109B
Please forgive me, master! I'll 
never do it again! If you spare 
me, I'll teach you something cool.You will never beat my brothers 
up ahead unless you punish them 
in the proper order.The order is...[Color LIGHTBLUE]2  3  1[Color DEFAULT]
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Twenty-three is number one![Color DEFAULT]Do you think I'm a traitor?

0x109C
How did you know our secret?!
How irritating!It's so annoying that I'm going to
reveal the secret of Queen Gohma
to you!In order to administer the coup de
grace to Queen Gohma, strike
with your sword [Color RED]while she's 
stunned[Color DEFAULT].Oh, Queenie...Sorry about that!

0x109D
In the vast, deep forest of Hyrule...Long have I served as the
guardian spirit...
I am known as the Deku Tree...

0x109E
The children of the forest, the
Kokiri, live here with me.Each Kokiri has his or her own
guardian fairy.

0x109F
However, there is one boy[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]who
does not have a fairy...

0x10A0
I surrender! In return, I will sell 
you Deku Nuts!
[Color RED]5 pieces   20 Rupees[Color DEFAULT] they are!

0x10A1
All right! You win! In return,

0x10A4
YIKES!!

0x10A5
Not enough Rupees! 
Come back again!

0x10A6
You can't have this now!
Come back again!

0x10A7
Thank you very much!

0x10A8
I've been waiting for you,
!This is the [Color RED]Sacred Forest Meadow[Color DEFAULT].
It's[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]my secret place!
I feel...This place will be very 
important for both of us someday.
That's what I feel.If you play the Ocarina here, you 
can talk with the spirits in the 
forest.

0x10A9
Would you like to play the 
Ocarina with me?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
Don't do it[Color DEFAULT]

0x10AA
OK, try to follow along with the
melody I will play.
Are you ready?

0x10AB
Huh?!
How boring!
C'mon! Play along!

0x10AC
Great! Great!Please don't forget this song!
Do you promise?

0x10AD
When you want to hear my voice,
play [Color ADJUSTABLE]Saria's Song[Color DEFAULT]. You can talk 
with me anytime...

0x10AE
Are you taking good care of 
my Ocarina?

0x10AF
Cool!
You're great!  You scored
three perfect bull's-eyes!I have to give a neat present
to such a wonderful person!
Please take it!

0x10B0
Mido might know something about
Saria's whereabouts.I think Mido is sulking in one of 
the houses around here.

0x10B1
[Color LIGHTBLUE]??
[Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]No response. He's sleeping.[Color DEFAULT]

0x10B2
Cojiro?  Why?
Normally only a nice guy like me 
can tame you...Which means...You... You must be a nice guy!
Must be!
You must be!!
Please Mr. Nice Guy! Please!Deliver this stuff to the [Color RED]old
hag in the potion shop [Color DEFAULT]in Kakariko
Village!

0x10B3
This will disappear if you take
too long, so you gotta hurry!
[Color ADJUSTABLE]OK
I can't[Color DEFAULT]

0x10B4
Oh, yeah. That's it!
You aren't a nice guy after all!!
Get away from me!

0x10B5
Saria wanted to see you...
Did she find you already?

0x10B6
Hurry up, nice guy!
Before it disappears, deliver it
to that old wench....

0x10B7
That guy isn't here anymore.Anybody who comes into the 
forest will be lost.Everybody will become a Stalfos.
Everybody, Stalfos.
So, he's not here anymore.
Only his saw is left. Hee hee.

0x10B8
That medicine is made of 
forest mushrooms. Give it back!
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x10B9
Heh heh heh.
Are you going to be... too?
Heh heh!

0x10BA
We sell shields, but not swords!

0x10BB
You know [Color ADJUSTABLE]Saria's Song[Color DEFAULT]! We should
be friends! Here, take this!

0x10BC
Hi! Do you think my face is kind
of plain?
It's just not very unusual...

0x10BD
Let's play again sometime!

0x10BE
Follow along with our song on 
your Ocarina. We'll lead you 
into it.

0x10BF
That was quite a nice session.
As a token of our friendship, 
please take this.

0x10C0
Hey, over here!
Hoo hoo!...Good to see you
again! Listen to this!
Hoot hoot....

0x10C1
After going through the Lost 
Woods, you will come upon the 
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Sacred Forest Meadow[Color DEFAULT].That is a sacred place where few
people have ever walked.Shhhh...What's that?
I can hear a mysterious tune...You should listen for that tune
too...
Hoo hoo ho!

0x10C2
Do you want to hear what I said
again?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x10C3
If you are courageous, you
will make it through the forest
just fine...Just follow your ears and listen
to the sounds coming from the
forest! 
Hoot hoot!

0x10C4
Hoo hoo!Did you learn an Ocarina song
from Saria?That melody seems to have some
mysterious power.There may be some other 
mysterious songs like this that
you can learn in Hyrule.

0x10C5
If you hold the Ocarina with [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT]
where a melody is necessary, a 
[Color RED]musical staff [Color DEFAULT]will appear.I recommend that you play a song
you know.I also suggest that you play even
when a score is not displayed. 
Just like this:
Hoo hoo hoo hoot hoot hoot!

0x10C6
Do you want to hear what I
said again?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x10C7
Melodies you have learned 
will be recorded on the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Quest 
Status Subscreen[Color DEFAULT]. You should 
memorize those melodies.

0x10C8
Ohh...That bum! I don't know why 
he's always so mean to everyone!What he said is true, though.

0x10C9
The forest...strange things have
been happening here lately...You need to be ready for anything.
You'd better find a weapon!

0x10CA
All right! You win! In return,
I will sell you [Color RED]Deku Seeds[Color DEFAULT]!
[Color RED]30 pieces   40 Rupees[Color DEFAULT] they are!

0x10CB

I will sell you a [Color RED]Deku Shield[Color DEFAULT]! It's
[Color RED]50 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]!

0x10CC
I quit! If you let me go, I'll sell 
you some [Color RED]Bombs[Color DEFAULT]!

0x10CE
All right! You win! If you spare 
me, I will sell you a [Color RED]Red Potion[Color DEFAULT] 
for [Color RED]40 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]!

0x10CF
All right! You win! Spare me, and
I will sell you a [Color ADJUSTABLE]Green Potion[Color DEFAULT] for 
[Color RED]40 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]!

0x10D0
What?! You've got a fairy?!
Say what? The Great Deku Tree
actually summoned you?

0x10D1
Whaaaaaaat?!Why would he summon you and not 
the great [Color RED]Mido[Color DEFAULT]?This isn't funny...I don't believe it!
You aren't even fully equipped
yet!How do you think you're going to 
help the Great Deku Tree without
both a [Color ADJUSTABLE]sword[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]and [Color LIGHTBLUE]shield[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]ready?What? You're right, I don't have
my equipment ready, but...

0x10D2
Eh, what's that?!Oh, you have a [Color LIGHTBLUE]Deku Shield[Color DEFAULT]...And what's THAT?!Is that the [Color ADJUSTABLE]Kokiri Sword[Color DEFAULT]?!GOOD GRIEF!!

0x10D3
Well, even with all that stuff, 
a wimp is still a wimp, huh?

0x10D4
I lost! Now I'll sell you a [Color RED]Deku 
Stick [Color DEFAULT]for [Color RED]15 Rupees[Color DEFAULT].

0x10D5
I lost! Now I'll sell you [Color RED]Deku 
Nuts [Color DEFAULT]if you leave me alone.
[Color RED]5 pieces   20 Rupees [Color DEFAULT]they are.

0x10D6
And also...I'm sorry for being mean to him.Tell him that, too.

0x10D7
Hee hee hee!
You came all the way up here?
You're a real man!

0x10D8
Look! Isn't this view pretty?
Change your viewpoint with [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT],
so you can look around the forest
with [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT].

0x10D9
What did you do to the Great
Deku Tree?

0x10DA
If you want to go to the Lost 
Woods, you'd better equip the
right gear!
Hee hee!

0x10DB
All my young Deku Scrub brothers
say...
You have a horrible face!But don't worry! We will reward
you with many [Color RED]Deku Nuts[Color DEFAULT].Of course, we will also enable 
you to carry more of them!Abracadabra...Alakazaaaam!!

0x10DC
I surrender!To make your quest easier,
I can enable you to pick up more
[Color RED]Deku Sticks[Color DEFAULT]!
But, it'll cost you [Color RED]40 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]!

0x10DD
I surrender!To make your quest easier, I can
enable you to pick up more [Color RED]Deku
Nuts[Color DEFAULT]!
But, it'll cost you [Color RED]40 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]!

0x10DE
So sorry!
You can't buy that right now!

0x10DF
That guy isn't here anymore.Anybody who comes into the 
forest will be lost.Everybody will become a Stalfos.
Everybody, Stalfos.
So, he's not here anymore.

0x2000
Thank you very much for the 
other day... I haven't even asked
you your name yet...........Really?
!That's what I thought!
You're the fairy boy from the
forest! That was years ago!
Do you remember me?You do? I was sure it was you
because Epona remembered you!Oh, I have to tell you about
[Color RED]Mr. Ingo[Color DEFAULT]...He was afraid that the Evil King
might find out that Epona had
been taken away...It really upset
him!But one day, all of a sudden, he
went back to being a normal, [Color RED]nice
person[Color DEFAULT]!Now my dad is coming back...I
can't believe it, but peace is
returning to this ranch!It's all because of you! I
owe you so much!Thank you! Thank you,
!

0x2001
How is [Color RED]Epona [Color DEFAULT]doing?If you play [Color RED]Epona's Song [Color DEFAULT]with
your Ocarina, she will surely
come to you.Please come back to the ranch
whenever you want to [Color RED]train 
[Color DEFAULT]Epona!

0x2002
Epona[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]looks great!
It looks like you were able
to tame her, too!

0x2003
How about trying your skill with
Epona on an [Color RED]obstacle course[Color DEFAULT]?I'll time you for [Color RED]two laps[Color DEFAULT].
It's pretty challenging. If you
miss jumping a fence in the 
proper order, you'll fail.How about it?
Do you want to try? 
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Let's go
Don't do it[Color DEFAULT]

0x2004
Well, your time was [Color RED][Color DEFAULT].
You have to train harder!Remember, you don't need to 
accelerate to jump over low 
fences, but you do need to go
fast to jump the high fences!

0x2005
...can you hear me?
It's me, Zelda...

0x2006
Moooooooooo!What a nice song...
It reminds me of the pasture...That song makes me feel so good,
I can produce a lot of milk!

0x2007
Have some of my refreshing and 
nutritious milk!

0x2008
, when you hold
this Ocarina in your hand...I won't be around anymore...I wanted to wait for you, but I
couldn't delay any longer...At least I could leave you the 
Ocarina and [Color LIGHTBLUE]this melody[Color DEFAULT]...

0x2009
Now, .
Play this melody in front of the
altar in the Temple of Time.
You must protect the Triforce!

0x200A
Wha-ha-ha-hah! Do you think 
you're in disguise, Mr. Hero?Oh?Is that a "Kee...something..."
character mask? I heard he's 
very popular recently?He's my boy's favorite. That
"Kee...something..." mask...
If you don't mind...

0x200B
Will you sell it to me?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No way[Color DEFAULT]

0x200C
I won't give up! I have plenty of
patience. I have to for this 
job!  Hah hah hah!

0x200D
Mmmm...mumble...mumble...
Huh? Yeah, I'm awake!What?Hey, it's you! Welcome!Awww... That was rough!
Malon yelled at me for a long
time!You took care of us, so I'm proud 
to give you this [Color RED]milk[Color DEFAULT]! You can 
keep the bottle for yourself.

0x200E
The [Color RED]road is closed [Color DEFAULT]beyond this
point!
Can't you read the sign over 
there?Eh? Oh, I see. You're just a kid,
and you can't read yet. 
Ha ha hah!

0x200F
I don't want that!

0x2010
Oh, this is...
This is surely Princess Zelda's 
handwriting! Well, let's see...
Hmmm... OK..."[Color PURPLE]This is ...
[Color DEFAULT][Color PURPLE]He is under my orders to save
[Color DEFAULT][Color PURPLE]Hyrule.[Color DEFAULT]"Wah ha ha ha hah!
What kind of funny game has our
Princess come up with now?!OK, OK, all right.  You can go 
now... Just be careful, Mr. Hero!
Wah hah ha ha hah!

0x2011
Oh, Mr. Hero!
Thanks for all your hard work!
Wah ha ha hah!!

0x2012
Wow! Great!
Your time was [Color RED][Color DEFAULT]!
You and Epona are a great
team!

0x2013
Oh, that's too bad.
If you had something to put it in,
I could give some to you...

0x2014
I am [Color RED]Ingo[Color DEFAULT]--Mr. Ingo to you.
I take care of these horses.
You're in my way, so scram,
kid!

0x2015
By the way, Mr. Hero...If you're going to climb 
Death Mountain, you should equip
a [Color LIGHTBLUE]proper shield[Color DEFAULT]! It is an active
volcano, after all!If you go back to Hyrule Castle
Town Market, you should check
out the Bazaar. They sell the
shield you need there.Tell 'em I sent you and they
should give you a special 
discount!If you think you're good to go
already, don't worry about it.Now, I'd like to ask a favor of 
you. No, I don't expect you to do
it just because of the great tip I
just gave you! I'm just asking!Have you been to the [Color RED]Happy
Mask Shop[Color DEFAULT] that just opened in
the Hyrule Castle Town Market?
Everyone is talking about it!My little boy pesters me for a 
popular mask, but I don't have
time to go there...So, could you go and get the
mask for me next time you are in
the Market? If you don't feel like
it, that's OK, but...Well, I have no choice, this is my 
job......sigh...

0x2016
I wish I could go to the [Color RED]mask
shop [Color DEFAULT]in town to buy a present for
my kid......sigh...

0x2017
Oh no... He's not breathing...

0x2018
!?

0x2019
Arrrrgh! I lost her!

0x201A
You, over there! 
Little kid!

0x201B
Heh heh heh...
You want a piece of me?!
Very funny!
I like your attitude!

0x201C
Pathetic little fool!
Do you realize who you are
dealing with?!

0x201D
I am [Color RED]Ganondorf[Color DEFAULT]!
And soon, I will rule the world!

0x201E
You must have seen the white
horse gallop past just now...
Which way did it go?!
Answer me!!

0x201F
Tsk tsk...When your time is
up, I'll kick you out of here.

0x2020
My boy will be very happy with 
this! You really are Mr. Hero!
Wha ha ha hah!

0x2021
You sold the 10-Rupee mask for 
[Color RED]15 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]. You earned a little
profit.Let's go to the Mask Shop and
pay back the mask price of 
[Color RED]10 Rupees[Color DEFAULT].

0x2022
Little kids can't go on the 
"[Color RED]Heart-Pounding Gravedigging
Tour[Color DEFAULT]" described on the sign.Since I can't do that, I'm just 
imitating Damp the gravekeeper 
all day.But with my cute face, I'm not
heart-pounding at all, am I?

0x2023
Gyaah! It's Damp the 
gravekeeper!???Oh, it's just a mask. I get a 
different kind of fright from that
mask than I get from Damp...Will you give that mask to me?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No way[Color DEFAULT]

0x2024
I really do have some money, you
know.

0x2026
With this mask, I'll be just like 
Damp! 
Here's my money!

0x2027
You sold the 30-Rupee mask to a
kid for full price?! 
And he didn't mind paying at all!Let's go back to the mask shop to
pay [Color RED]30 Rupees [Color DEFAULT]for the mask. 
You can get the new mask 
model, too.

0x2028
I'm gonna dig and dig! 
Just like Damp!!

0x2029
In old times, I heard there were 
many wild rabbits in the land 
of Hyrule. Not anymore, though, 
because of excessive hunting.I want to become a rabbit...
Listen to the wind with 
those ears, hop across the ground
with those legs...Even if I can only pretend.

0x202A
I bet with those long ears you 
can hear the voices... 
Oh, these are genuine rabbit
ears from the animal of legend!

0x202B
I don't care how expensive it is!
Please sell it to me!
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No way[Color DEFAULT]

0x202C
That's not the answer I wanted to 
hear!

0x202D
My long time dream! Returning to
the wild life! Finally, the actor, 
stage and prop have been united!

0x202E
It's a 50-Rupee mask, but he paid
you a crazy amount of money for
it--more money than you can 
count!Go back to the Mask Shop and 
pay back just [Color RED]50 Rupees [Color DEFAULT]of this
money.

0x202F
So, you think you can protect
them from me...
You've got guts, kid.

0x2030
There are some people in Kakariko
spreading rumors that I cheated
Talon out of the ranch, but...Don't be ridiculous!That guy Talon was weak!
I, the hard-working [Color RED]Ingo[Color DEFAULT], poured 
so much energy into this place!I don't want any strangers like
you saying anything bad about me!Listen. The [Color RED]great Ganondorf
[Color DEFAULT]recognized my obvious talents and
gave the ranch to me!I will raise a fine horse and
win recognition from the great 
Ganondorf!Say, young man, do you want
to ride one of my fine horses?

0x2031
Pay me [Color RED]10 Rupees [Color DEFAULT]and you can 
ride.
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Ride
Don't ride[Color DEFAULT]

0x2032
All right then, scram 
ya little punk!

0x2033
You don't have enough!
Save your change and 
come back again!

0x2034
Do you want to hear how to ride?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Listen
Don't listen[Color DEFAULT]

0x2035
Approach the horse quietly and 
stand by its side. Press [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT] to 
mount up.Use the [Color LIGHTBLUE] [Color DEFAULT]to make it run. 
Once it starts running, press
[Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT] to tap it with the whip. 
It will speed up!When you want to jump over a
fence, accelerate and hit it
head on!If you try to jump over a fence 
at an angle, the horse won't like
it, and it won't jump.After the horse comes to a 
complete stop, press [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT] to 
dismount. Now, have fun!

0x2036
If you use [Color LIGHTBLUE] Targeting[Color DEFAULT], you can 
talk to me from horseback.Are you ready to go home so 
soon?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]No, I want to ride.
Yes, I'm done.[Color DEFAULT]

0x2037
When you want to dismount, stop 
and press [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT].Hey young man!
Do I know you? I just felt as 
though I've seen you
somewhere before...

0x2038
You're getting better!
How about a little race with me?
One lap around the corral with
that horse.Let's make a little wager, say
[Color RED]50 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Do it
Don't do it[Color DEFAULT]

0x2039
Hey hey... What's the matter?
Don't you have even 50 Rupees?!
I don't want to race with someone
so poor!

0x203A
Sh-shoooot!If the great Ganondorf found out
about this humiliation...
Hey, you!!  How about another
race!  If you win...You can keep...the horse!!

0x203B
What's up with that horse?!
Is that [Color RED]Epona[Color DEFAULT]?How did you tame that wild horse
right under my nose?!I was going to present that horse
to the great Ganondorf... But I bet
it on the race and lost! Shooot!

0x203C
Hah ha hah!As I promised, I'll give the 
horse to you...However...I'll never let you leave this ranch!

0x203D
Hee hee hee... Too bad for you!
I get your 50 Rupees.

0x203E
Wah ha hah!
You're just a kid, after all!
Well, come back any time and we'll
have some more fun...

0x203F
What?  What are you doing 
hanging around here?
You little weirdo!I am [Color RED]Ingo [Color DEFAULT]and I mind the ranch.I've been working at this ranch 
for a long time for that lazy
bum, Talon.Today, for example, he's gone
somewhere for a delivery and he 
hasn't come back yet!So, I'm doing all the work around
here.

0x2040
Oh well...It's tough to be a
working man.

0x2041
Hey, your clothes! They're...
different...
You're not from around here, 
are you?.................Ohh... You're a fairy boy from 
the forest! My name is [Color RED]Malon[Color DEFAULT]!
My dad owns Lon Lon Ranch!

0x2042
Dad went to the castle to deliver
some milk, and he hasn't come
back yet...

0x2043
Are you going to the castle,
fairy boy?
Would you mind finding my [Color RED]dad[Color DEFAULT]?He must have fallen asleep 
somewhere around the castle. 
What a thing for an adult to do!
Tee hee!Oh yeah, if you'll look for him, I'll 
give this to you.I've been incubating this
egg very carefully...
Tee hee!

0x2044
Set the egg to [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT] to incubate it.
Hee hee!My dad is really troublesome,
for an adult, isn't he?!
Hee hee!

0x2045
I can't believe that I, the great
[Color RED]Ingo[Color DEFAULT], am working on this dump of
a ranch!Because the owner is so lazy, I
always have to do all the work 
around here!

0x2046
I, the hard-working [Color RED]Ingo[Color DEFAULT], should be 
in charge, not that lazy bum, 
Talon!

0x2047
Oh, it's the fairy boy again!I heard that you found my dad!
How did you like the castle? Did
you see the Princess? Hee hee!Dad came home in a hurry after
you found him. Hee hee!Oh yeah, I have to introduce you
to my friend, fairy boy!She's this horse. Her name is
[Color RED]Epona[Color DEFAULT]. Isn't she cute?

0x2048
It seems like Epona is afraid of 
you, fairy boy...

0x2049
My mother composed this song.  
Isn't it nice?  Let's sing together.

0x204A
Oh, Epona!  She's grown fond of
you, fairy boy.

0x204B
Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z...

0x204C
Oh...a visitor!
It's been a long time since we've
had a visitor here...
Where did you come from?Since Ganondorf came, people in
the Castle Town have gone, places
have been ruined, and monsters
are wandering everywhere.Mr. Ingo is just using the ranch
to gain Ganondorf's favor...Everyone seems to be turning evil...But Dad...
He was kicked out of the ranch
by Mr. Ingo...If I disobey Mr. Ingo, he will treat
the horses so badly...So...
There's nothing I can do...

0x204D
I bet nobody is faster than I am 
now! But, I don't know if I 
should be happy or sad....

0x204E
Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z...
S-stop that song...I...I...
Mumble... mumble...

0x204F
Take a good look at that 
mountain. That is [Color RED]Death Mountain[Color DEFAULT],
home of the Gorons. They hold
the Spiritual Stone of Fire.

0x2050
Please keep it secret from 
Mr. Ingo that I sing this song...

0x2051
You...
Do you know my [Color RED]mother's song[Color DEFAULT]?Everyone really liked that song...
My dad... Even Mr. Ingo...But...since Ganondorf appeared,
Mr. Ingo has changed completely.I can remember the good old days
only while I sing the song. Also...

0x2052
[Color RED]Epona[Color DEFAULT] really liked that song...
Only I could tame that horse...
Even Mr. Ingo had a hard time...Hee hee hee!

0x2053
This statue's one-eyed gaze 
pierces into your mind...

0x2054
Responding to your mask, this 
strange stone statue talks to 
you...I overheard this...

0x2055
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf 
and work real hard from now on.

0x2056
Mr. Ingo... He must have been 
tempted by evil powers.
He's not really a bad person 
at all...

0x2057
Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z...
Mumble... It's not easy to
be a working man...

0x2058
It's been a while...
Do you want to race?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x2059
If you change your mind,
come back anytime!

0x205A
All right then! Scram,
ya little punk!

0x205B
Heh heh... Are you mad because 
you lost? If you're that upset,
how about another race?Bet [Color RED]50 Rupees [Color DEFAULT]and race again?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Race
Don't race[Color DEFAULT]

0x205C
Thank you so much. Heh heh!

0x205D
If I give ya more free of charge,
Ingo will get mad at me. So I'd
better sell it to you for the
normal price.

0x205E
Wanna buy milk for [Color RED]30 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Buy
Don't buy[Color DEFAULT]

0x205F
Hi there, how are you?
I am Ingo. I feel so honored
to be allowed to work here.

0x2060
You brave lad...
We must protect this beautiful
land of Hyrule!

0x2061
Oh, cute ocarina!
Are you going to play this song
with that ocarina?

0x2062
At the foot of Death Mountain
you will find my village, [Color RED]Kakariko[Color DEFAULT].
That is where I was born and 
raised.You should talk to some of the
villagers there before you go up
Death Mountain.

0x2063
The song I just taught you has
some mysterious power. Only 
Royal Family members are allowed
to learn this song.Remember, it will help to prove
your connection with the Royal 
Family.The Princess is waiting for you to 
return to the castle with the
stones. All right. We're counting
on you!

0x2064
Hoo hoot!
...
Look up here!It appears that the time has 
finally come for you to start your 
adventure!You will encounter many hardships
ahead... That is your fate. Don't 
feel discouraged, even during the
toughest times!

0x2065
Go straight this way and you will
see [Color RED]Hyrule Castle[Color DEFAULT].You will meet a [Color RED]princess [Color DEFAULT]there...If you are lost and don't know 
which way to go, look at the 
[Color RED]Map[Color DEFAULT].The areas you have explored will 
be shown on the Map. Press 
[Color RED]START [Color DEFAULT]to enter the Subscreens
and [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT] or [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT] to find the Map.On the [Color RED]Map Subscreen[Color DEFAULT], you will
also see a [Color RED]flashing dot[Color DEFAULT] showing
you which way you should go next.

0x2066
Did you get all that?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]No
Yes[Color DEFAULT]

0x2067
All right then, I'll see you around!
Hoot hoot hoot ho!

0x2068
Hey, ! This way!The princess is inside the castle 
just ahead. Be careful not to get 
caught by the guards!
Ho ho ho hoot!

0x2069
On this ground, time flows 
normally.But time stands still while you
are in Lon Lon Ranch or in a town.If you want time to pass normally,
you'll need to leave town.Well, well, which way are you 
going to go now?
Hoo hoo hoot!

0x206A
Do you want to hear what I said 
again?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x206B
Hoooo. You're a smart kid.
Good luck, then. Hoo hoo.

0x206C
Hey, ! 
Wait a second, friend!Beyond this point you'll find 
[Color RED]Kakariko Village[Color DEFAULT]. Have you seen 
the Princess of Hyrule? If not, 
I suggest you go to the castle.

0x206D
Hey, ! 
Look over here!Beyond this point you'll find
[Color RED]Kakariko Village[Color DEFAULT]. Watch your step!
Hoot hoo!

0x206E
, you're the only
one who can complete the quest
ahead!
You must do your best! Hoo!

0x206F
! Wait up, buddy!
Hoo hoo!Head south from here to reach
[Color RED]Lake Hylia's [Color DEFAULT]full, rich waters.If you go west, you'll find 
[Color RED]Gerudo Valley[Color DEFAULT]. There's a hideout
of a gang of thieves on the other
side of the valley.Well, you're free to go anywhere
you want!
Ho ho ho...hooo!

0x2070
No matter how hard it is, just
don't get discouraged. Ho Ho Hoo!

0x2071
Beyond this point lies Lake Hylia.
It is full of deep, pure water.The [Color BLUE]Zoras[Color DEFAULT], who live all the 
way upstream, guard the sunken
temple at the lake's bottom, as 
well as Zora's Fountain.If you want to confirm its location 
on the map, press [Color RED]START [Color DEFAULT]to 
switch to the Subscreens and [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT] 
or [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT] to find the Map.All the places you have visited 
will be shown on the map. 
Ho hoo hoot!

0x2072
OK, be careful and go!

0x2073
What is your name?

0x2074
.....[Color ADJUSTABLE][Color DEFAULT]...Strange...it sounds somehow... 
familiar.

0x2075
OK then, ...I'm going to tell you the secret of
the Sacred Realm that has been
passed down by the Royal Family
of Hyrule.

0x2076
The Ocarina of Time!

0x2077
Did you understand well the story
I just told you?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x2078
I was spying through this window
just now...The other element from my
dream...the [Color BLUE]dark clouds[Color DEFAULT]...
I believe they symbolize...
that man in there!Will you look through the window
at him?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x2079
........Yes.I told my father about my dream...However, he didn't believe it was
a prophecy...But...I can sense that man's evil
intentions!

0x207A
What Ganondorf is after must be 
nothing less than the [Color RED]Triforce 
[Color DEFAULT]of the Sacred Realm.He must have come to Hyrule to
obtain it!And, he wants to conquer Hyrule...
no, the entire world!

0x207B
...now, we are the 
only ones who can protect Hyrule!

0x207C
We must not let Ganondorf get
the Triforce!I will protect the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Ocarina of Time
[Color DEFAULT]with all my power! 
He shall not have it!You go find the other [Color RED]two
Spiritual Stones[Color DEFAULT]!Let's get the Triforce before
Ganondorf does, and then defeat 
him!

0x207D
One more thing...
Take this [Color RED]letter[Color DEFAULT]...
I'm sure it will be helpful to you.

Are you making sure to approach
the fences head on? If you 
approach at an angle, the horse
won't jump!If you want to try again, mount
Epona and get ready!

0x208F
You did it!
[Color RED][Color DEFAULT] is the new course record!I have to give you a present to
commemorate your new record!The present is a little too heavy

Kid, I like you!How's about you and I become
Sworn Brothers?!No, there's no big ceremony
involved! Just take this as a
token of our friendship!

0x3005
You did great!

0x3006
How 'bout a big Goron hug, 
Brother?!

0x3007
Oh!Oh-oh!C'mon!Come on! Come on! Come on!HOT!!What a hot beat!WHOOOOAH!YEEEEAH!YAHOOO!!

0x3008
I am one of the [Color RED]Gorons[Color DEFAULT],
the stone-eating people who live
on Death Mountain.Look at that huge boulder over
there!It blocks the entrance to the
[Color RED]Dodongo's Cavern[Color DEFAULT], which was once
a very important place for us
Gorons...But one day, many Dodongos
suddenly appeared inside the 
cavern. It became a very 
dangerous place!On top of that, a [Color RED]Gerudo in black
armor [Color DEFAULT]used his magic to seal the
entrance with that boulder!0

0x3009
I wish I could roll down the 
mountain like a rock, with a
[Color RED]Bomb Flower [Color DEFAULT]and...[Color RED]BOOOOOOM![Color DEFAULT]If I could do that with a Bomb 
Flower, I could become a real man.

0x300A
I'm standing here to shade the
[Color RED]Bomb Flowers [Color DEFAULT]from the sun.Do you have a question for me?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Ask about Bomb Flowers
Ask about Dodongo's Cavern[Color DEFAULT]

0x300B
Those plants growing over there 
are [Color RED]Bomb Flowers[Color DEFAULT]. They are
"mining plants" that grow only on
this mountain.The flower's fruit is the raw 
material for bombs.But a non-Goron amateur should 
never pick the Bomb Flowers' 
fruit!They usually grow only in dark 
places, so Bomb Flowers that grow
in a place like this are extremely
rare.

0x300C
Those plants growing over there 
are [Color RED]Bomb Flowers[Color DEFAULT]. They are
"mining plants" that grow only on
this mountain.They usually grow only in dark 
places, like caves, so Bomb 
Flowers that grow in a place like
this are extremely rare.If you have the [Color RED]Goron's Bracelet[Color DEFAULT],
even a little kid like you could
easily pick it with [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT].

0x300D
Did you see the cavern on your 
way here? That is the [Color RED]Dodongo's 
Cavern[Color DEFAULT].Because the light inside is very 
dim, the [Color RED]Bomb Flowers[Color DEFAULT], a plant 
unique to this mountain, grow like
crazy in there!

0x300E
Oh?We don't get many visitors way
up here. Where are you from?The forest?What's a "forest"?Eh?It's where a lot of "trees" and 
"plants" grow?Now I'm even more confused! 
Nothing grows around here besides
the [Color RED]Bomb Flowers[Color DEFAULT]...We don't have "seeds" or "nuts"
around here either.Even Deku Sticks are very scarce
around here!0

0x300F
I sealed the entrance because I
don't have much merchandise to
sell. But you're quite a persistent
customer, aren't you.

0x3010
I'm sorry...
That Bomb is just for display. 
I'm [Color RED]sold out [Color DEFAULT]of real ones.

0x3011
Why did you stop me?
Don't stop me here!You can't stop my wild rolling!This wild rolling is the only way
to relieve my stress!Now stand in awe of my wild, wild
rolling!!

0x3012
All right! I'll give you this
in praise of your courage!

0x3013
Thank you! Let me express my joy
with more wild rolling!

0x3014
Oh...I'm so hungry...Everyone feels faint from hunger
because of the food shortage in 
this town. We are in danger of 
extinction!It's all because we can't enter
our quarry, the [Color RED]Dodongo's Cavern[Color DEFAULT].We Gorons live on a diet of 
rocks...And the most delicious and 
nutritious rocks around are found 
in the Dodongo's Cavern! But that 
seems like ancient history now...We've become such gourmets that 
we can't stand to eat rocks from
anywhere else!0

0x3015
Sigh... I want to eat the top
sirloin rocks from the [Color RED]Dodongo's 
Cavern[Color DEFAULT]!

0x3016
Hey!It's dangerous for a little kid like
you to come out here. You might 
fall down!If I'm not mistaken, you came out
here to eat the [Color RED]red stone[Color DEFAULT]!
Well, too bad! It's not here!What? That's not why you're
here?You're looking for a "Spiritual
Stone?" You must mean that 
delicious-looking red stone
that was once displayed here!I was so hungry that I thought
it would be OK to just give it one
tiny little lick...so I snuck out
here. But, it was already gone!I think Big Brother took it away.He always says that everyone
is after that red stone!0

0x3017
Big Brother has shut himself up in
his room saying,
"[Color RED]I will wait in here for the 
Royal Family's messenger![Color DEFAULT]"

0x3018
I'm so hungry that I can't think
about anything but food!Ask Big Brother about complicated
things.If he's in a bad mood, he'll 
probably get mad at you...it
can be pretty scary. But...I know his SECRET.He may not look like the type,
but Big Brother loves to dance!
If he gets in a rhythm, he'll surely...0

0x3019
I remember Big Brother used to
always listen to the [Color ADJUSTABLE]music that
comes from the forest[Color DEFAULT]...Ah yes, the good old days...
That music makes me feel
nostalgic, too...0

0x301A
What the heck! Who are you?!When I heard the [Color BLUE]song of the
Royal Family[Color DEFAULT], I expected their 
messenger had arrived, but...
you're just a little kid!Has [Color RED]Darunia[Color DEFAULT], the big boss of
the Gorons, really lost so much
status to be treated like this
by his Sworn Brother, the King?Now, I'm REALLY angry!
Get out of my face, now!Are you asking why I'm in such a
bad mood right now?Ancient creatures have 
infested the Dodongo's Cavern!We've had a poor harvest of our
special crop, Bomb Flowers!Starvation and hunger because
of the rock shortage!But...0

0x301B
This is a Goron problem!We don't need any help from
strangers!

0x301C
Heeey!! What a nice tune!Just like that, my depression is
all gone! Something just came 
over me! I suddenly wanted to
dance like crazy!I am [Color RED]Darunia[Color DEFAULT]!I'm the big boss of the Gorons!
Was there something you wanted 
to ask me about?What?You want the [Color RED]Spiritual Stone of
Fire[Color DEFAULT], too?The Spiritual Stone of Fire, also
known as the Goron's Ruby, is our
race's hidden treasure....But hold on--I'm not going to give
it to you that easily.
If you want it so badly...Why don't you go destroy the 
monsters inside of the Dodongo's 
Cavern and prove you're a real man?That way, everybody will be 
happy again! If you do it, I 
will give you anything you want,
even the Spiritual Stone!I have something for you. I'm not
really giving you this in
return for anything, but take it
anyway.If you wear this, even a little 
fella like you can pick a [Color RED]Bomb 
Flower [Color DEFAULT]using [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT].

0x301D
Destroy the monsters in the
[Color RED]Dodongo's Cavern [Color DEFAULT]and become a 
real man! Then, we can talk about
the Spiritual Stone!

0x301E
Hey, Brother, play that tune
again sometime soon!

0x301F
No matter how many times I hear 
that song, it doesn't get old!

0x3020
Well, that's not quite what I 
was looking for...I wanted to hear...a tune...
something...um...from outside 
the mountains...something...
green...natural...That's the kind of music I want 
to hear...

0x3021
Oh, now we can enter the cavern.
You're so smart!

0x3022
I know a trick to conserve sticks!
If you light a stick on fire, it will 
burn to ashes. Press [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT] to put it
away before it completely burns!By the way, I hid a stick
somewhere...
Hehehee...

0x3023
It's me, [Color RED]Darunia[Color DEFAULT]!
Well done!Thanks to you, we can once again
eat the delicious rocks from the
Dodongo's Cavern until our 
stomachs burst!

0x3024
I'm so hungry that I can't think
about anything but food!"Spiritual Stone?"
That [Color RED]red stone[Color DEFAULT] that was lighting
up our city?Big Brother [Color RED]Darunia[Color DEFAULT] took it
away. Then, he shut himself up in
his room and won't come out.Since then, it feels like all
the lights in the city have gone 
out... Everyone seems so...
depressed...0

0x3025
I want you to bring [Color RED]fire[Color DEFAULT] from Big
Brother's room back here.

0x3026
Oh, I see...
We should have thrown the 
Bomb from the cliff...

0x3027
You are incredible, destroying 
the Dodongos! Do you mind if I 
call you Big Brother?

0x3028
Thanks to you, we're all OK!
Why don't you buy some Bombs 
now?

0x3029
You know, I'm so grateful to you.
When I have a kid, I will name it
after you!

0x302A
If you want to hear more Goron
gossip, head up to our city![Color RED]Goron City[Color DEFAULT] is just a little
way up the trail. It won't take
much longer to get there, even
on foot.

0x302B
You pick the Bomb Flowers with 
[Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT]. Press [Color BLUE] [Color DEFAULT]again to set it.

0x302C
When all the [Color RED]torches[Color DEFAULT] on this floor
are lit, Goron City is really lively!

0x302D
Are you going to clear out the 
Dodongos? It's a Goron problem,
though. You're a nosey little kid,
aren't you?!Well, of course we'll be happy if 
you fix it so we can get all the
Bombs we want, like we used to...Just let me warn you, though...
Dodongos are scary creatures! 
They'll eat ANYTHING!!So watch yourself, and don't 
get eaten!

0x302E
I already told you!
We're out of Bombs!
Ohhh... I'm so hungry!

0x302F
How was Big Brother?
I see...By the way, do you know the
music coming from deep inside of
this tunnel? We all like this music!

0x3030
I won't let you get me! 
You probably work for Ganondorf!

[Color ADJUSTABLE]About the dragon
About the Gorons[Color DEFAULT]

0x3035
A long time ago there was an
evil dragon named [Color RED]Volvagia [Color DEFAULT]living 
in this mountain.That dragon was very scary!
He ate Gorons!Using a huge hammer, the hero of
the Gorons... BOOOM!Destroyed it just like that. This is 
a myth from long ago, but it's 
true!I know, because my dad is a
descendant of the hero!0

0x3036
Everybody was taken to the 
[Color RED]Fire Temple[Color DEFAULT]...While my dad was out...
Ganondorf's followers[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]came and
took them all away!All of them will be eaten by
[Color RED]Volvagia[Color DEFAULT]!Dad said that Ganondorf has
revived Volvagia...As a warning to those who might
oppose him, Ganondorf is going to
feed them all to Volvagia!Dad went to the Fire Temple all
by himself to try to save 
everyone...Please help, !
I'll give you this [Color RED]heat-resistant
tunic[Color DEFAULT]!

0x3037
Dad told me not to let anybody 
follow him to the temple, but...Only you, , can
save everyone!I'm sure that the shop owner, who
is hiding somewhere right now, will
also help you!Now, I'll tell you about the secret
passage to the Fire Temple!0

Who's there?  Is that you,
...?Oh, it really is !You've grown so big since I last
saw you!I want to have a man-to-man talk
with you, but now's not the time.Ganondorf is causing trouble on
Death Mountain again!
He has revived the evil, ancient
dragon Volvagia!On top of that, he is going to
feed my people to that evil dragon
as a warning to other races that
might resist him...If that fire-breathing dragon
escapes from the mountain, all of
Hyrule will become a burning
wasteland!I will go on ahead to try to seal
up the evil dragon...I'm concerned, though, because I
don't have the legendary hammer...
But I have no choice....I'm asking you to
do this as my Sworn Brother...While I'm trying to deal with the
dragon, please save my people!The prisoners' cells are in the
opposite direction.
I'm counting on you,

What a wild adventure! It will
make an incredible story...I can't believe that the Dodongos

You've done well to come all the
way up here, . 
This is the summit of the sacred
Death Mountain! Hoot!It is said that the clouds 
surrounding this peak reflect the
condition of Death Mountain. When
they look normal, it is at peace.Climbing all the way up here
just proves how smart you are!
Now I want to see you make
another smart move...The [Color RED]Great Fairy[Color DEFAULT] lives on this
mountaintop, and she will give
you a new skill! She is the leader
of the fairies, you know. Hoo!I will perch here and wait for you.
When you're ready to go back
down, I can help you! 
Now, get going!

0x3063
Hoo hoot!
Well, it looks like you've grown
up a little from the Great Fairy's
power...But you still don't really look like
the hero who will save Hyrule. At
least not yet!If you are going back [Color RED]down the
mountain[Color DEFAULT], I can lend you a wing.
Come here and grab my talons!
And hold on tight! Hoo hooooooot!

on top of Death Mountain! She
will power you up!Hey, everybody! Let's see off our
Brother!

0x3069
I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!In this temple, there are [Color RED]doors
that fall down [Color DEFAULT]when you try to 
open them. When one of these
doors starts to fall, move!If you use a sample of the
Goron "special crop," you can
break it...

0x306A
Let me tell you a secret as
a reward for releasing me!When you are on fire, you can put
it out by swinging your sword, or
by rolling forward... Did you know
that?

0x306B
Here's a tip for rescuing me!Somewhere in this temple, you're
sure to meet up with some 
creatures that dance as they
attack. Arrows won't hurt them!Looks like you might need some of
the Goron "special crop!" That's
all I have to tell you!

0x306C
I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!There are switches in this temple
that you have to cut to activate.
But, you can also use the Goron
"special crop" to do the job.

0x306D
I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!If you find a place that you can
see on the map, but can't reach,
try playing your Ocarina!

0x306E
I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!In order to get into the room
where Darunia went, you have to
do something about the pillar
stuck in the ceiling.Find a path that leads to a room
above the ceiling right away!

0x306F
I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!A door is hidden inside the statue
at the entrance to this temple.But, the Goron "special crop" won't
work on it... Don't you have
anything stronger?

0x3070
Here's a secret for saving me!A wall that you can destroy with
the Goron's "special crop" will
sound different than a regular
wall if you hit it with your sword.

0x3071
Are you releasing me?
Am I free to go?

0x4002
!
This way!  Hoo hoo!I wonder what [Color RED]Saria[Color DEFAULT] is doing now?
How about going back to the
forest sometime?

0x4003
What are you doing? You've come 
a long way to get up here...You should look at the [Color RED]Map 
Subscreen [Color DEFAULT]sometimes., this is a beautiful
lake full of pure, clear water.At the lake bottom there is
a [Color BLUE]Water Temple [Color DEFAULT]used to worship 
the water spirits. The [Color BLUE]Zoras [Color DEFAULT]are
guardians of the temple. Hoo hoo.The Zoras come from Zora's
Domain in northeast Hyrule. An
aquatic race, they are longtime
allies of Hyrule's Royal Family.I heard that only the Royal Family
of Hyrule can enter Zora's Domain...
Hoo hoo!I'm on my way back to the [Color RED]castle[Color DEFAULT].
If you want to come with me, hold
on to my talons!

0x4004
I'm on my way back to the [Color RED]castle[Color DEFAULT].
If you want to come with me, hold

already inside this bottle.
It's a [Color RED]letter[Color DEFAULT]:"[Color PURPLE]Help me.

Well, what do you want from us?

0x4007
We are good at diving!
How about you?If you want to be a master diver,
try the [Color RED]diving game[Color DEFAULT] at the top 
of the waterfall!
Have you tried it already?

0x4008
Zora's Fountain is the 
source of the river.
[Color RED]Lord Jabu-Jabu [Color DEFAULT]lives in the 
fountain.@

0x4009
Lord Jabu-Jabu is the patron deity
of the Zoras. [Color RED]Princess Ruto[Color DEFAULT] is in 
charge of preparing his meals, 
morning and night.

0x400A
We Zoras all serve the great 
[Color RED]King Zora[Color DEFAULT].

0x400B
The great King Zora should be in
the [Color RED]Royal Chamber[Color DEFAULT].

0x400C
Have you seen Lord Jabu-Jabu?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x400D
According to the "Legend of Zora,"
the act of offering a [Color RED]fish[Color DEFAULT] to Lord 
Jabu-Jabu will make you happy.

0x400E
Oh, that's not good.Everybody who comes around here 
should see [Color RED]Lord Jabu-Jabu[Color DEFAULT] at 
least once!Zora's Fountain is just beyond 
King Zora's throne. That is where
Lord Jabu-Jabu swims. But...unless you have King Zora's
permission, you can't go to 
Zora's Fountain.

0x400F
We haven't found [Color RED]Princess Ruto
[Color DEFAULT]even though some of us have 
searched as far as [Color BLUE]Lake Hylia[Color DEFAULT]....

0x4010
If you find any clues to
[Color RED]Princess Ruto's [Color DEFAULT]whereabouts,
will you show them to King Zora?

0x4011
All of the water in Hyrule flows
from [Color BLUE]Zora's Fountain[Color DEFAULT].That water flows through Zora's
River, which eventually reaches
[Color BLUE]Lake Hylia [Color DEFAULT]to the south.

0x4012
Oh--I've come back to life!Was it you who saved me?
Don't be nervous!It looks like you have a hard time
breathing underwater.As an expression of my gratitude,
I grant you this [Color RED]tunic[Color DEFAULT]. With this,
you won't choke underwater.

0x4013
Princess Ruto has gone to Lake 
Hylia and has not come back...
I'm so worried...again!

0x4014
Ooh...
This is... well... hmmm...
Hmmm... [Color RED]Eye drops[Color DEFAULT]...You might say we have them,
you might say we don't...
We do have the ingredients.If you take the [Color RED]ingredients [Color DEFAULT]to the
doctor at the lake laboratory, he
can make the drops for you.But you need to deliver them
fresh...@

0x4015
Can you make it [Color RED]before they
spoil[Color DEFAULT]?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x4016
Then you think they'll spoil 
before you can get there?
It's not that far if you make the 
connection on horseback...

0x4017
Hoot hoot!, you look like 
you're getting more comfortable
in your role as adventurer.I think Princess Zelda is 
waiting for you to visit her again.You already have the [Color RED]Goron's Ruby[Color DEFAULT],[Color RED]
[Color DEFAULT]don't you?

0x4018
Hello there, son. I'm researching 
the process of making medicine by 
mixing Lake Hylia's water with 
various unusual compounds.Perhaps you've met that old lady 
from the potion shop...she is like 
a student of mine...
Ho ho ho!

0x401A
Oh, my dear, sweet [Color RED]Princess Ruto[Color DEFAULT]...
Where has she gone?
I'm so worried...

0x401B
Ho, this letter! 
It's from [Color RED]Princess Ruto[Color DEFAULT]!!Hmmm...Let's see...
She's inside Lord Jabu-Jabu?
That's not possible!Our guardian god, [Color RED]Lord Jabu-Jabu[Color DEFAULT],
would never eat my dear Princess
Ruto!But since that stranger, [Color RED]Ganondorf[Color DEFAULT],
came here, Lord Jabu-Jabu has 
been a little green around the
gills...The evidence seems clear.
Of course, you'll go find Ruto.
You can pass through here to the 
altar of Lord Jabu-Jabu.I'll keep this letter. You keep the 
[Color RED]bottle [Color DEFAULT]it was in. Take it 
respectfully!@

0x401C
Please find my dear [Color RED]Princess Ruto[Color DEFAULT]

0x4027
My mother gave it to me and said 
I should give it only to the man

0x4028
Don't tell my father...

0x4029
Heeheehee... Don't be shy.I can tell what you're thinking...@

I really appreciate it!

0x402C
Did my most precious possession

a king. Oh yeah, he does.The grand King Zora has a 
Princess named [Color RED]Ruto[Color DEFAULT]. She's an

seems like she's always causing
the King a lot of trouble!@

0x4031
Hoo hoo! Looks like you've gotten
bigger and stronger already,
!Just ahead lies [Color BLUE]Zora's Domain[Color DEFAULT]. 
The Zoras serve Hyrule's Royal

Hooo hoo hoooot!

0x4032

You don't know what she's talking

all three Spiritual Stones!!Go back to see Princess Zelda!

0x4036
We meet again, ...

0x4037
This ice is created by an evil
curse... The monster in the [Color BLUE]Water
Temple [Color DEFAULT]is the source of the curse.Unless you shut off the source, 
this ice will never melt....If you have courage enough to 
confront the danger and save 
the Zoras, I will teach you the 
melody that leads to the temple.

0x4038
Time passes, people move....
Like a river's flow, it never ends...A childish mind will turn to
noble ambition... Young love will
become deep affection... The clear 
water's surface reflects growth...Now listen to the [Color BLUE]Serenade of 
Water[Color DEFAULT] to reflect upon yourself....

0x4039
If you came here to meet the 
Zoras, you wasted your time...
This is all there is...With one exception, the Zoras 
are now sealed under this thick 
ice sheet...I managed to rescue the Zora
princess from under the ice, but... 
she left to head for the [Color BLUE]Water 
Temple[Color DEFAULT]...

0x403A
If you want to buy fish, you need
a container to put them in.

0x403B
You say you want to buy a [Color BLUE]Zora
Tunic[Color DEFAULT]? That tunic is made of the

exceedingly expensive!In fact, I'm afraid only that [Color RED]very

long years...But now is not the time to talk 
about love...I'm sure you've already seen it!
Zora's Domain--totally frozen!A young man named [Color RED]Sheik[Color DEFAULT] saved 
me from under the ice...But my father and the other

I want to save Zora's Domain!You! You have to help me!
This is a request from me, the
woman who is going to be your

0x4045
Ah, I see...
Princess Ruto went to the Water
Temple...

0x4046
As a reward...
I grant my eternal love to you.Well, that's what I want to say, 
but I don't think I can offer that
now.

Princess Zelda... She's alive. I can
sense it...so don't be discouraged.

Ahem...P

0x5010
I am one of the ghostly composer 
brothers of Kakariko Village.All the people in this village are
born to serve the Royal Family of
Hyrule.We brothers also served the Royal 
Family, and were assigned to 
study the hereditary mystic 
powers of the family.Though we never could figure out 
the power of the Triforce,we had almost completed our 
[Color RED]study of controlling time[Color DEFAULT] with the 
tones of ocarinas.Uh, I mean...Actually, we did complete that 
study!We would have been famous, if 
that hateful Ganondorf had not
tried to steal our results.We could never let him reap the 
fruits of our research!That's why we gave our lives to 
protect the secret.P

What? You again?Somehow, you remind me of...
Princess Zelda...Hmm... Since you may have some
connection with the Royal Family, I
will tell you a little more of our
tale.Back then, people called us great
composers because of the many 
musical masterpieces we wrote.But we brothers were not just 
composers.We had a mission to analyze the
mysterious powers of Hyrule's
Royal Family.Our names would be a part of 
Hyrule's history if we could 
complete our research!We kept our study extremely 
secret until we completed it.P

0x5013
GYAAAAH!
I'M DEAD AGAIN!
What? You again?Somehow, you remind me of
Princess Zelda.Since you seem to have some
connection with the Royal Family, I

story.P

0x5014
To tell the truth, each of us
was studying a different song, one
to [Color RED]summon the sun[Color DEFAULT] and another to
[Color RED]summon the moon[Color DEFAULT].If you were really sent by a 
member of the Royal Family, I will
tell you about the results of our
study.We inscribed it on the [Color RED]royal
tombstone[Color DEFAULT].As a messenger of the Royal 
Family, you should show your
Royal credentials on top of the

, the hero!Finally, all of us, the [Color RED]six Sages[Color DEFAULT], 
have been awakened!
The time for the final showdown
with the King of Evil has come!Before that, though, you should
meet the one who is waiting for
you...The one who is waiting for you at
the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Temple of Time[Color DEFAULT]....

0x5025
We Sheikah have served the 
royalty of Hyrule from generation
to generation as attendants.
However...On that day seven years ago,
Ganondorf suddenly attacked...
and Hyrule Castle surrendered
after a short time.Ganondorf's target was one of
the keys to the Sacred Realm...the
hidden treasure of the Royal
Family...The Ocarina of Time!My duty bound me to take Zelda 
out of Ganondorf's reach.When last I saw you, as we made
our escape from the castle, you
were just a lad...Now I see that you have become 
a fine hero...

0x5026
I have to stay here... You go to 
Princess Zelda's side and protect 
her on my behalf.Now I put my power, which should 
be helpful to you, into this
[Color BLUE]Medallion[Color DEFAULT]!

0x5027
How is your Cucco? Is he happy?
Shall I check him out for you?

0x5028
I am the [Color RED]boss of the carpenters
[Color DEFAULT]that Impa hired to improve this
village and make it into a true
city!But young men these days don't
have any ambition...
Do you know what I mean, kid?My workers are just running
aimlessly around the village, and
they're not making any progress
at all...Even my own son doesn't have a 
job, and he just wanders around
all day!P

0x5029
They're all worthless, I tell you!!

0x502A
Look at that poor girl over there.
She works so hard taking care of 
her chickens, even though touching
them gives her goose bumps...What a trooper! I would really 
like to help her! I've just been
feeling so charitable these days!
Don't you feel that way, too?

0x502B
There's nothing to worry about...
The Princess is safe now.

0x502C
Soon, you'll meet Princess Zelda
face-to-face, and she will explain
everything...That is when we, the six Wise 
Ones, will seal up the Evil King
and return peace to Hyrule.

0x502D
Hehehe, young man...
You were very quick to be able
to keep up with me! Hehehe!As a reward, I'm going to give
you my treasure. It's called the
[Color RED]Hookshot[Color DEFAULT]!Its spring-loaded chain will pull
you to any spot where its hook
sticks. Doesn't that sound cool?
I'm sure it will help you!I live here now, so come back
again sometime. I'll give you
something cool!One more thing! Be careful on
your way back!
Heheheh....

0x502E
You're back, young man...
Was the present I gave to you
fun and useful?

0x502F
The time of this race was
!!

0x5030
Looks like you're coming around...

0x5031
I believe Impa has gone to the 
[Color PURPLE]Shadow Temple [Color DEFAULT]to seal it again,
but...she will be in danger without 
any help!!
Impa is one of the six Sages.
Destroy the evil shadow spirit and
save Impa!There is an entrance to the 
Shadow Temple beneath the 
graveyard behind this village.The only thing I can do for you is
teach you the melody that will
lead you to the Shadow Temple...This is the melody that will draw
you into the infinite darkness 
that absorbs even time... Listen to 
this, the [Color PURPLE]Nocturne of Shadow[Color DEFAULT]!!

0x5032
Go around! Go around and around
and around! What fun! I'm so 
happy!I'm a music man who loves
to go around and around!
Go around and around!!!I'm trying to come up with a
musical theme inspired by this 
windmill...going around and
around and around!!!

0x5033
Go around, go around, go around...
What? It's going way too fast!

0x5034
Grrrrrrrrr!I'll never forget what happened on
that day, seven years ago!
Grrrrrrrrr!It's all that Ocarina kid's fault!
Next time he comes around here,
I'm gonna mess him up!

0x5035
What?! You've got an ocarina!!What the heck!That reminds me of that time,
seven years ago!Back then a mean kid came here 
and played a [Color PURPLE]strange song[Color DEFAULT]. It 
messed up this windmill!

0x5036
What should I do!?
My [Color RED]Cuccos[Color DEFAULT] have all flown away!You, little boy, please!
Please help me bring them back to 
this pen!

0x5037
My Cuccos have run away!
Please help me bring the other 
four back to this pen! Please!

0x5038
My Cuccos have run away!
Please help me bring the other 
three back to this pen! Please!

0x5039
My Cuccos have run away!
Please help me bring the other 
two back to this pen! Please!

0x503A
My Cuccos have run away!
Please help me bring the last one
back to this pen! Please!

0x503B
Thank you for finding my Cuccos.
I have allergies, so I get 
goose bumps when I touch them.For helping me, I will give this
to you. It's fine glass, and should
be useful. Please take good
care of it!

0x503C
Hey, what are you doing?!
Now go round them up or pay for 
them!

0x503D
Please don't tease my Cuccos!

0x503E
I bred a new type of miniature 
Cucco! I call it the [Color RED]Pocket 
Cucco[Color DEFAULT]! I don't get goose bumps
from this baby.[Color RED]Cuccos [Color DEFAULT]are very good at 
getting lazy, late-risers out of bed.
Haven't you heard of them 
before?It makes them very happy to crow:
[Color RED]CUCCKOOOO[Color DEFAULT]!
especially when it wakes up a 
very heavy sleeper!However, my Cucco is not entirely
happy right now...You..., 
You look like you're good at 
handling Cuccos.Here, take this egg.
After the Cucco hatches, bring it 
back to me after a while, and I'll 
check out its mood.P

0x503F
What do you think? 
Will you try?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x5040
Oh, too bad...were you pecked by
a Cucco when you were little?

0x5041
Heh heh heh, young man!
Are you fast on your feet?I may not look like it, but I'm 
confident in my speed!
Let's have a race! 
Follow me if you dare!

0x5042
Please make my Cucco happy!
OK?

0x5043
Oh, your Cucco looks pretty 
happy! He must have awakened an
extremely lazy guy!You're a good Cucco Keeper!
I'll give you a rare, valuable
Cucco, if you're interested...Its name is [Color RED]Cojiro[Color DEFAULT],[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]and it used to
be my brother's Cucco. Its
blue body is quite charming.
It's so cute!Since my brother has gone, 
it's strange, but Cojiro has 
stopped crowing.P

0x5044
Do you want to keep [Color RED]Cojiro[Color DEFAULT]?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x5045
It looks as if you really like that
other Cucco. OK, you can keep it
for a while.

0x5046
An old witch runs the Potion Shop
behind this one. You can get to 
that shop through the door to the
left of the counter.

0x5047
My brother must have been very 
lonely...

0x5048
I heard that the [Color ADJUSTABLE]Lost Woods[Color DEFAULT], 
where fairies live, is a strange
place with many mysterious smells.I wish I could just once make 
medicine with some of the strange
things I might find there...I may not be able to see very 
well anymore, but my nose still 
works fine!  Hehehe!

0x5049
Sniff sniff sniff...What a mysterious smell...You must have something!

0x504A
That bum! He had to go into the 
forest...
.....I see.P

0x504B
Hey, give it to me now!

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x504C
How sad... I just need a little...

0x504D
If you see that fool, give this to 
him. It is the strongest medicine
I have ever produced.However, this potion will not
work on a monster...

0x504E
Hey, kid! If you want to carry 
medicine, you need a container to
put it in!

0x504F
They say that there is no 
medicine that can cure a fool...
I guess that's true...

0x5050
I can't get down, so all I can do
is look at [Color RED]Death Mountain[Color DEFAULT].

0x5051
I can't get down, so all I can do 
is look at the stars.

0x5052
Can you see it from there? 
Something is happening on [Color RED]Death 
Mountain[Color DEFAULT]!

0x5053
Can you see it from there?
[Color RED]Death Mountain [Color DEFAULT]is back to normal!

0x5054
I don't feel like getting down,
ever! Whatever happens, I'll keep
watching Death Mountain from 
up here.

0x5055
Hey! Good to see you again! I'll
give you this as a memento.

0x5056
To get a good view, use [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT] and 
look around with [Color LIGHTBLUE][Color DEFAULT].

0x5057
Hey! Kid, do you always enter
other people's houses without 
permission? Didn't your parents 
teach you any manners?Oh well.Did you see a lady behind this 
house? She's going through hard 
times.Oh well.P

0x5058
If that lady asks you about 
chickens, you should listen to her.

0x5059
Is visiting other people's houses 
at this late hour your idea of 
fun? You must not have had a 
good upbringing.Oh well.P

0x505A
That lady takes care of chickens,
but she is, in fact, allergic to 
them.Oh well.

0x505B
Hey! Young man! A grown boy
like you entering a person's house
without permission?! I want to
talk to your parents!Oh well.This isn't my house anyway.
This is the [Color RED]great Impa's[Color DEFAULT] house!The great Impa has gone to the
[Color RED]graveyard [Color DEFAULT]to seal up the 
humongous creature there.Since Ganondorf appeared, many 
monsters have been sighted 
around here.Only the great Impa has kept 
peace in our village. You have to
remember that, young man!Oh well.Speaking of the great Impa, she
hasn't come back yet. I wonder 
what happened to her?P

0x505C
I heard that the [Color RED]ghost of the
gravekeeper [Color DEFAULT]often appears in the 
graveyard behind this village...But, no big deal.

0x505D
Hi, boy! Is this the first time
you've visited this village?A great woman, [Color RED]Impa[Color DEFAULT], opened up
this village to us poor folk.P

0x505E
Well, make yourself at home.
The food isn't ready yet, though.

0x505F
The great Impa is not here. Did
something happen to her?

0x5060
All people have hardships in 
their past that they would
rather no one found out about.P

0x5061
Look at the bearded man sleeping
over there. I bet even someone
like him has had his share of
troubles in the past...

0x5062
That bearded guy went back to 
the ranch. He looked so happy!

0x5063
Ding dong, ding dong!
I'm a clock soldier of Kakariko!
The current time is: .Hello there, son.
Zelda's attendant, the great [Color RED]Impa[Color DEFAULT],
opened this village to the common
people.We have only a small population 
now, but someday this place will 
be as lively as Hyrule Castle 
Town! Oh, yes! It will!Climb up the [Color RED]stairs at the north
[Color DEFAULT]end of the village to find the trail
that leads up Death Mountain.But you need the King's permission
to actually go up the mountain.

0x5064
Ding dong, ding dong!
The current time is: .

0x5065
Ding dong, ding dong!
The current time is: .
By the way, do you know what 
happened in the castle?

0x5066
Hey, son, what are you doing 
wandering around this late at 
night?Oh, I get it. You're testing your
courage, aren't you? You must 
want to go to...a graveyard!Wait a minute! What am I doing
talking to a kid? I've got work to
do! Work! Work!P

0x5067
Ding dong, ding dong!
The current time is: .Head east and you'll find a
[Color RED]graveyard[Color DEFAULT]. Legends say you can 
calm the souls of the dead with
an [Color BLUE]old song of the Royal Family[Color DEFAULT].

0x5068
There's a strange guy living in the 
Windmill. Have you already met
him, Mr. Hero?

0x5069
People are disgusting. 
My own father and mother are
disgusting.
You must be disgusting, too!

0x506A
All day long, we are working on 
many construction projects in the
village. It's going to take awhile
before everything is done.Our boss works us very hard!

0x506B
I'm starving!
Let's eat dinner, right now!

0x506C
Those guys each do the work of 
half a man, but they still want a
full man's portion!
They're lazy slackers, I tell you!

0x506D
[Color RED]Poe   30 Rupees

Sell it to someone who is crazy 
about weird things like this.

Abandon ship!
Get onto a safe platform![Color DEFAULT]

0x5072
I'm still missing some Cuccos!
Please round up five more!

0x5073
Don't cause trouble!
I'll tell Damp!

0x5074
Look at this, kid! My beautiful,
smooth hands are all worn out 
from working. Sob sob...

0x5075
A job where you can make a lot
of money without much effort...
The only thing I can think of is
thievery... Is that a bad idea?

0x5076
I heard that our boss's house is
just behind this house. He doesn't
want any of us to know, though.

0x5077
Have you seen [Color RED]Mr. Damp[Color DEFAULT], who
lives in the graveyard up ahead?It's  right now, so he's
probably asleep in his hut.Why don't you go out onto the 
field and kill some time?

0x5078
I'm starving!
Isn't dinner ready yet?
It's  already!

0x5079
This used to be the [Color RED]great 
Impa's house[Color DEFAULT], but she doesn't
live here any longer.It is now open to all 
villagers. You are free to
go on in.P

0x507A
This village used to be a 
[Color BLUE]Shiekah [Color DEFAULT]village, but the 
great Impa opened it to 
everyone.

0x507B
I tell you, I saw him!I saw the ghostly figure of Damp
the gravekeeper sinking into
his grave. It looked like he was
holding some kind of [Color RED]treasure[Color DEFAULT]!

0x507C
There he is! It's him!
He's the one who dropped from
the sky surrounded by a blue
light!Now do you believe me?

0x507D
Nobody believes what I've been
telling them all these past 
seven years!

0x507E
The fire almost consumed us all!
But together, we all were able to
put out the fire! Pretty good
work, don't you think?

0x507F
Wah hah hah hah hah hah!Look at this guy! Ever since
he escaped from Hyrule Castle
Town, he's become even more
timid!

0x5080
Wah hah hah hah hah hah!He must have been seeing things!
Wah hah hah hah hah hah!

0x5081
Wah hah hah hah hah hah!
Those are some funny-looking
clothes, man!

0x5082
Wah hah hah hah hah hah!
When times are tough, laughter is
the best medicine!
That's what my dad always said!

0x5083
Look at me! I'm on top of the 
world! It really bothers me to see
anyone at a higher level than I
am! I have to be on top!

0x5084
If I fall asleep up here, I'll
surely fall down...

0x5085
The windmill draws water up from 
the depth of the well.Now the well is dried up, though.
Hrrrrm...

0x5086
The lady here is really
generous. She even took care of
the carpenters when they were
here!

0x5087
A long time ago...
There was a man in this very
village who had an eye they said
could see the truth!Now usually, you have to train
your mind's eye most strenuously
to actually see the truth...But this fella, no, they say he
had a different way of doing
things...His house stood where the well is
now...

0x5088
Folks around here tell of a
[Color RED]fabulously rich family [Color DEFAULT]that once
lived in one of the houses in this
village...But they say that the entire
family was cursed due to their
greed!Who knows what might happen to
those who are consumed by
greed...

0x5089
Heh....What an annoying person,
interrupting us like this...
Don't you agree, my love?

0x508A
Hee hee...Violating our personal space!
He must have something better
to do...
Don't you agree, darling?

0x508B
Look at him...the man with the
beard. I think he was fired from
his job at the ranch...P

0x508C
He's always just lazing around, 
morning, noon and night. 
He's an awfully carefree guy 
during such hard times.

0x508D
That lazy man, he kind of 
reminded me of my little Richard...What's that? You say you've
never heard of my little Richard?
He was such a famous puppy! You 
seriously haven't heard of him?

0x508E
Oh, no! A storm again!!
You played the Ocarina again,
didn't you!!
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!

0x508F
You caught a Big Poe!
Sell it at the [Color RED]Ghost Shop [Color DEFAULT]for a
lot of money!

0x6000
Halt! Stay where you are!

0x6001
Hey, newcomer!

0x6002
Hey, newcomer! Wait a second 
and I'll open the gate for you.

0x6003
Don't take us so lightly!

0x6004
I've seen your fine work. To get 
past the guards here, you must 
have good thieving skills.I used to think that all men, 
besides the great Ganondorf, were 
useless...but now that I've seen
you, I don't think so anymore![Color RED]The exalted Nabooru[Color DEFAULT], our leader, 
put me in charge of this fortress.Nabooru is the second-in-command
to the great Ganondorf, King of 
the Gerudo Thieves.Her headquarters are in the [Color YELLOW]Spirit
Temple[Color DEFAULT], which is at the end of the
desert.Say, you must want to become 
one of us, eh?
All right, then!
You're in from now on!Take this. With it, you will
have free access to all areas of
the fortress!

0x6005
From now on, you're free to come
and go as you please through the 
gate to the desert.You'll find the [Color YELLOW]Spirit Temple[Color DEFAULT],[Color YELLOW] 
[Color DEFAULT]where the exalted Nabooru lives,
out there in the desert.

0x6006
Stupid Kid!
Get in there and keep quiet!

0x6007
I have no idea where you 
come from, but you must have a
lot of guts to make it past all
the guards around here!All of my fellow carpenters
are imprisoned somewhere in here.If you can get us out of here,
we'll repay the favor somehow!But be careful! There're sure
to be [Color RED]Gerudo [Color DEFAULT]guards somewhere 
around here....Woo! Watch out!

It's out of the question if you 
don't have a horse!

I won't have anything to do with a
coward like you!

0x6011
Ah, you are not as good as you 
claim. Maybe next time.

0x6012
You did well.For today, I admit I lost. 
It seems I have a lot of room for 
improvement.

0x6017
Hey, rookie!Are you going into the desert?
I'll open this gate for you, but...You can't cross the desert 
unless you pass the [Color RED]two trials[Color DEFAULT].`

0x6018
The first trial is...the [Color RED]River of 
Sand[Color DEFAULT]! You can't walk across this
river! After you cross it, follow
the flags we placed there.The second trial is...the [Color RED]Phantom
Guide[Color DEFAULT]!Those without [Color RED]eyes that can see
the truth [Color DEFAULT]will only find themselves
returning here.You are going anyway, aren't you?
I won't stop you...
Go ahead!

0x6019
Why did you come all the
way down here? What? You were
just about to ask me the same 
thing?`

0x601A
Well, now that you're down here, 
you may as well make the best of 
things!

0x601B
Good kid! Thanks!
I'm sorry that I can't give you
something as good in return, but...
take this anyway!

0x601C

0x601D
I haven't seen you around, kid...What do you want?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]To see the temple
Looking for the Sages
Nothing, really[Color DEFAULT]

0x601E
You're just a kid! The temple is
no place for kids!

0x601F
A Sage? I don't know anyone
like that.

0x6020
You have nothing to do? What 
good timing! Can you do me a 
favor, kid?Wait a second, I want to ask you
first--you wouldn't happen to be
one of Ganondorf's...followers...would you?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]What if I am?
I hate Ganondorf![Color DEFAULT]

0x6021
Wha-ha-ha!
Don't try to act cool, kid.
I was just asking!A kid like you could never be
one of Ganondorf's followers!Well, let's cut to the chase...`

0x6022
Uh-huh!You've got guts.
I think I like you.`

0x6023
First of all, let me introduce 
myself. I'm [Color RED]Nabooru [Color DEFAULT]of the Gerudo.
I'm a lone wolf thief.But don't get me wrong!Though we're both thieves, I'm 
completely different from
Ganondorf.With his followers, he stole
from women and children, and he 
even killed people!A kid like you may not know this, 
but the Gerudo race consists only
of women. Only one man is born
every hundred years...Even though our laws say that
lone male Gerudo must become
King of the Gerudo, I'll never
bow to such an evil man!By the way, what is your name, 
kid??!What kind of name is that?
Well...anyway...`

0x6024
I want to ask you a favor...Will you go through this tiny hole
and get a treasure that's inside?The treasure is the [Color BLUE]Silver
Gauntlets[Color DEFAULT]. If you equip them, you
can easily push and pull very 
heavy things!No, no, no, kid! Don't even think
about taking this treasure for 
yourself!The Silver Gauntlets won't fit a
little kid like you if you try to 
equip them! I want you to be a 
good boy and give them to me!Ganondorf and his minions are
using the Spirit Temple as a 
hideout.Only the Silver Gauntlets will 
allow me to sneak deep into the
temple.Once there, I'm going to steal all
the treasure inside and mess up
their plans!How about it? Will you do it?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x6025
Thanks, kid!You and I, let's give Ganondorf
and his followers a big surprise,
shall we?`

0x6026
If you can successfully get the 
[Color BLUE]Silver Gauntlets[Color DEFAULT]...I'll do something great[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]for you!

0x6027
Well, what did I expect?
After all, you're just a kid!

0x6028
Hey! Where are you taking me?!

0x6029
Ho ho ho!
Looks like someone is here, Koume.

0x602A
Hee hee hee!
Looks like it, Kotake!

0x602B
What an outrageous fellow he is,
to intrude so boldly into our

Ho ho ho!

Oh, loyal minion...

Destroy this intruder on 
our behalf!

0x602F
Great Ganondorf's...Enemy...
Must die...

0x6030
Unnnh...
Where am I...?

0x6031
Well, well...
Looks like she's back to normal...
Koume...

0x6032
She's just a little girl,
but she commands a lot of 
respect among the Gerudo, Kotake...

0x6033
Maybe we should make her work
for the great Ganondorf for
a little while longer!
Ho ho ho!

0x6034
Then we should brainwash her
again!
Hee hee hee!

0x6035
Kid, let me thank you.Heheheh...look what the little
kid has become in the past seven
years--a competent swordsman!

0x6036
If only I knew you would become 
such a handsome man...I should have kept the promise
I made back then...

0x6037
Here, I'll give you [Color RED]this[Color DEFAULT]...
It's a very important thing to me.
Let's have a competition later!

0x6038
...see you again!

0x6039
By the way...I really messed up...I was brainwashed by those old
witches and used by Ganondorf to
do his evil will...But isn't it funny? That a person
like me could turn out to be the
[Color YELLOW]Sage of Spirit[Color DEFAULT]!And now, I'm going to fight
them as one of the six Sages!
Heh heh...I'm going to pay them back for
what they did to me!

0x603A
Kid...No...
, the Hero of Time!Instead of keeping the promise I
made back then, I give you this
[Color YELLOW]Medallion[Color DEFAULT]!Take it!

0x603B
Yeearggh! Let me go!!

0x603C
You, you fiends!
Ganondorf's minions!

0x603D
!
Get out of here! Now!

0x603E
These witches! They're using
black magic on me!

0x603F
Hey, newcomer! This is our 
[Color RED]horseback archery field[Color DEFAULT].After a lot of hard practice and
training, we finally have the skill
to hit the bull's-eye while riding
like the wind!When you finally learn how to ride
a horse, you should come back
and try it. It's a dangerous sport,
but it's fun!

0x6040
Hey newcomer, you have a fine 
horse!I don't know where you stole 
it from, but...OK, how about challenging this 
[Color RED]horseback archery[Color DEFAULT]?Once the horse starts galloping,
shoot the targets with your
arrows. Let's see how many points you 
can score. You get 20 arrows.If you can score [Color RED]1,000 points[Color DEFAULT], I
will give you something good!

0x6041
Do you want to try for [Color RED]20 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x6042
Hey, rookie!
You're looking good!
Show me your skill again!You should set a new goal of
[Color RED]1,500 points[Color DEFAULT] and try again!

0x6043
What? Do you want to try again?
Looks like you have some
potential!

0x6044
I'll be darned! You are the ultimate
master!I will give you an item suitable
for the master.This quiver is very important to 
me. I want you to have it.
Take good care of it, OK?

0x6045
points...Hmm...
Wha-ha-ha! You have plenty of 
room for improvement!

0x6046
Fantastic!
You are a true master!I will give this to you.
Keep improving yourself!

0x6047
points...
Quite impressive!

0x6048
Look at that stupid kid!
He came on his own to offer 
himself as a sacrifice to the
great Ganondorf...

0x6049
With my flame, I will burn him to
the bone!

0x604A
With my frost, I will freeze him to
his soul!

0x604B
Shoot, what a fresh kid!
This time, we'll get serious,
right Kotake?

0x604C
What?Hey, Koume, what is that above
your head?

0x604D
I don't know, but you have one
over your head too, Kotake!

0x604E
But I'm only 400 years old!

0x604F
And I'm just 380 years old!

0x6050
We're twins! Don't try to lie
about your age!

0x6051
You must have gone senile!

0x6052
Who are you calling senile?!
Is that how you treat your
older sister?

0x6053
We are twins! 
How can you be older?

0x6054
Keeeyaaah!!
How heartless you are!

0x6055
How can you be so ungrateful?

0x6056
You're heartless!!

0x6057
You ungrateful...

0x6058
I'll come back to haunt you!

0x6059
OK, let's get serious now, Kotake!

0x605A
Oh, OK, Koume.Kotake and Koume's
Double Dynamite Attack!

0x605B
Did you come here to save me? 
Oh, that's just swell! I'm [Color RED]Ichiro
the carpenter[Color DEFAULT].We were really interested in 
joining their all-female group, but 
they locked us up like this just
because we're men!We don't care about the Gerudo 
anymore! They're so rude![Color RED]Three of my fellows[Color DEFAULT] have also 
been captured, so please help 
them escape, too!

0x605C
You're a cute kid! Thank you for
coming to save me! I'm [Color RED]Jiro, the 
carpenter[Color DEFAULT].These women are so scary! I'd
rather work as a carpenter than
join them!I can't wait to say good-bye to
this place! [Color RED]Two of my buddies [Color DEFAULT]
are still being held prisoner. Will
you please get them out, too?

0x605D
Thanks, boy! You're fantastic!
I'm [Color RED]Sabooro, the carpenter[Color DEFAULT].Have you seen our boss, boy?
He's probably worried about me!
I have to get back to him 
immediately![Color RED]One more of our workers [Color DEFAULT]is still
a prisoner. Please save him!

0x605E
I was afraid you were going to 
forget about me! Now I'm free!
Thanks! I'm [Color RED]Shiro the carpenter[Color DEFAULT].For rescuing me, I'll tell you
something interesting about the
desert that I overheard the
Gerudos talking about.They said, "In order to cross the
Haunted Wasteland, you'll need the
'[Color RED]eye of truth[Color DEFAULT].' The Colossus is on
the far side of the wasteland..."OK, now I'm going back to my
[Color RED]tent near Gerudo Valley[Color DEFAULT], so, 
drop by sometime. You may find 
something helpful there! Byeee!

0x605F
The leader of the gang of thieves
is [Color RED]Nabooru[Color DEFAULT]. She is experimenting 
in brainwashing many people at 
the ruins in the desert.

0x6060
Oh, it was Ganondorf the Evil
King who was behind the gang of 
thieves...

0x6061
When [Color RED]Nabooru[Color DEFAULT] was a lone wolf 
thief, she never stole from 
the weak, but...`

0x6062
Now, Nabooru's gang of thieves 
stands for cruelty and brutality.
She claims to be a chivalrous 
robber, but...no way!

0x6063
Like I suspected, Nabooru was 
brainwashed by Ganondorf's 
followers...

0x6064
In Gerudo society, those who have
great skill in horseback riding and
archery are well respected.`

0x6065
How about trying horseback 
archery at the Gerudo's Fortress?If you have a horse, a Gerudo 
from the fortress will set up 
your challenge.

0x6066
You did so great, young man!

0x6067
Building a bridge over the valley
is a simple task for four
carpenters.

0x6068
Without the old witches, the gang
of thieves isn't all that scary!

0x6069
The [Color RED]Gerudo's Fortress [Color DEFAULT]is located 
beyond this gate. A kid like you 
has no business there.

0x606A
I am a [Color RED]master craftsman[Color DEFAULT]. Those
Gerudo thieves...they broke the
bridge.I want to fix it, but all of my 
workers are gone!They said working as carpenters
isn't cool, and they went to the
[Color RED]Gerudo's Fortress [Color DEFAULT]to become 
thieves...`

0x606B
Hey, you! If you're going to the 
fortress, would you mind finding
out what my workers are doing
over there?

0x606C
Hey, I heard you saved my men.
When they returned, we built this
bridge.Look at this! 
Isn't it a fine bridge?They may be wimpy carpenters, 
but once they all got together,
they got the job done.

0x606D
Hey, that saw! It's mine!But... I thought I left that saw
with my old lady... Oh well...`

0x606E
My Biggoron tool broke, so I was
going to Goron City to get it
repaired.Your coming here is great timing.
Will you give me my saw?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x606F
What?!
You're a dirty, rotten thief!

0x6070
This is the Gerudo's [Color RED]Training 
Ground[Color DEFAULT]. Unqualified persons are 
not allowed.

0x6071
This is the Gerudo's[Color RED] Training
Ground[Color DEFAULT]. You're qualified...
C'mon in and hone your skills
as much as you want.

0x6072
This is the Gerudo's[Color RED] Training 
Ground[Color DEFAULT]. Even though you're 
qualified, don't hog all the 
treasure here for yourself!

0x6073
6073

0x6074
Oh, that's too bad.The mark that will lead you to the
Spirit Temple is the [Color RED]flag on
the left [Color DEFAULT]outside the shop.If you change your mind, please
come back again!

0x6075
Ohh, not enough Rupees.
No discounts, even a Rupee.

0x6076
Heh heh.
You're already in the middle of 
something, aren't you.If you want to challenge me, you
have to come here with a clear
mind. No other distractions!

0x6077
Well Come!I am selling stuff, strange and 
rare, from all over the world to 
everybody.
Today's special is...A dangerous, running object! 
Terrifying! 
I won't tell you what it is until 
I see the money....How about [Color RED]200 Rupees[Color DEFAULT]?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Buy
Don't buy[Color DEFAULT]

0x6078
Thank you very much!What I'm selling is...[Color RED]Bombchu[Color DEFAULT]!The mark that will lead you to
the Spirit Temple is the [Color RED]flag on
the left [Color DEFAULT]outside the shop.
Be seeing you!

0x6079
Hey, what's up, ?
Surprised to see me?A long time in this world is
almost nothing to you, is it?
How mysterious!Even I thought that the tales of a
boy who could travel back and
forth through time was merely a
legend., you have fully 
matured as an adult.`

0x607A
From now on, the future of all the
people in Hyrule is on your 
shoulders.Maybe it's not my time anymore. 
Here is my last advice.Two witches inhabit this temple. In 
order to destroy them, [Color RED]turn their 
own magic power against them[Color DEFAULT].
Hoo hoot!`

0x607B
Do you want to hear what I said
again?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x607C
I will continue to watch you...
Hoo hoo hoo hoot!

0x607D
I'm the wandering running man!
I've run all over this land in
search of true competitive spirit.I beat all my challengers, man and
beast.You're an athletic guy, and you
look like you might have a true
killer instinct, too.Now that the bridge over Gerudo
Valley is complete, I'm looking for
a challenger to have a 
commemorative race against.`

0x607E
The best time to go from here to 
the [Color ADJUSTABLE]bridge in the Lost Woods [Color DEFAULT]was
[Color RED][Color DEFAULT].  That's my record.Will you challenge my record?

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x607F
Excellent!
Then...You go first.
I'll give you a headstart.Now! Go ahead.

0x6080
Heh heh heh.
You'll never discover your
killer instinct with that
kind of attitude.

0x6081
Well, not perfect, but you
have some guts! Unfortunately,
you never can beat me. Your
record is a thing of the past.Your time was [Color RED][Color DEFAULT], wasn't it?
That was close, but I beat you
by one second!

0x6082
Heh heh heh.
Please. Go ahead.

0x6083
Oh, looks like you quit the race.
Heh heh heh. I bet you had almost 
rediscovered your killer instinct!

0x6084
Heh heh.
You don't have enough killer
instinct yet.Just train harder.
Good-bye, then!

0x6085
Huff...puff...huff...Huff...huff...whew!
You did quite well!But you couldn't beat me!
Your time was [Color RED][Color DEFAULT], but I
just beat you by one second!Huff...huff... 
You'll have to challenge me
again sometime!Huff...huff...
Good-bye, then!

0x6086
I'm the wandering running man!
I've run all over this land in 
search of competitors who have a
true killer instinct!I came here to run through the 
Haunted Wasteland, but it doesn't
look like good timing for that.Though I want to go back to 
Hyrule Field, the bridge is...well,
you can see it from here. So I'm
stuck here, inside this tent.I don't think I can accept your
challenge right now.
Heh heh!

0x7000
I can't catch that Cucco!

0x7001
Huff huff! 
I'm late! I'm late!
For a very important date!

0x7002
Welcome to Hyrule Castle Town.
It's a peaceful, prosperous town.

0x7003
Kids shouldn't be wandering around
town at nighttime! Stay indoors
until morning!

0x7004
Man, I am SO bored...
Things would sure be more
interesting if there were more...
troubles in the world...Hey, that's just between you and
me, OK?Anyway, maybe we can let off 
some steam by breaking these 
jars.Stand near a jar and press [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT] to
lift it. Press [Color BLUE][Color DEFAULT] again to toss it!

0x7005
That's great!I forgot to tell you...

0x7006
There's a lot going on in the 
castle right now. I can't allow
even a dog to get into the 
castle!

0x7007
Unnngh...are you the boy from 
the forest...?I-I-I've finally met you...
I-I-I have something to t-t-tell
you...[Color RED]Ganondorf[Color DEFAULT], the Gerudo King of
Thieves, betrayed our King...Zelda's nanny, [Color RED]Impa[Color DEFAULT], sensed danger
and escaped from the castle with
our Princess...I tried to stop Ganondorf's men
from chasing them...but...The Princess was...waiting for a
boy from the forest...that's you...
She wanted to give [Color RED]something [Color DEFAULT]to
the boy...If you received it from the 
Princess, hurry...to the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Temple of
Time[Color DEFAULT]....

0x7008
He's not moving anymore....

0x7009
Can you see the man with the 
evil eyes?That is [Color RED]Ganondorf[Color DEFAULT], the leader of 
the Gerudos. They hail from the 
desert far to the west.Though he swears allegiance to my 
father, I am sure he is not 
sincere.The dark clouds that covered 
Hyrule in my dream...
They must symbolize that man!

0x700A
Geh heh heh! Excellent work!As I thought, you held the keys
to the Door of Time!You have led me to the gates of
the Sacred Realm...Yes, I owe it all to you, kid!

0x700B
Please! If you don't hurry,
he'll be gone!

0x700C
Please...with [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT]...
Please sell me the [Color RED]contents[Color DEFAULT] of a
bottle...
Please...with [Color YELLOW][Color DEFAULT]...

0x700D
What a strange shop! 
I wonder when it'll be open for
business. I read the sign there, 
but it still seems weird!

0x700E
It seems like it's taking forever
for dawn to come...The view of Hyrule Castle in 
the morning sun is so fantastic!

0x700F
To save the forest girl, you need
[Color RED]another skill[Color DEFAULT]... 
Head to Kakariko Village!

0x7010
It looks like you have the
skills you need... 
The [Color ADJUSTABLE]forest girl[Color DEFAULT] is waiting for your
help....

0x7011
If you want potions, you'd better 
bring an empty bottle. Understand,
young man?

0x7012
I'm sorry, but this is just a model. 
Because of the crisis in Goron 
City, we haven't received any 
shipments lately and we're out.

0x7013
If you plan on scaling Death
Mountain, buy a [Color LIGHTBLUE]Hylian Shield[Color DEFAULT].
You can defend yourself against
falling rocks with that shield.But it might be a little bit 
big for a kid....

0x7014
I'm not dancing, you know...
My back itches! 
Ooh! Aaah! Ooh!

0x7015
They say we [Color LIGHTBLUE]Hylians [Color DEFAULT]have big ears
in order to hear the voices of the 
gods...but I've never heard them!

0x7016
Kid, have you been to 
[Color YELLOW]Lon Lon Ranch[Color DEFAULT]?Their milk is delicious!
There are many horses there, and
the young daughter of the ranch
owner is cute!p

0x7017
To get to [Color YELLOW]Lon Lon Ranch[Color DEFAULT], after
you leave town, head due south
across the field. You should visit
the ranch at least once!

0x7018
I wanted to see [Color RED]Princess Zelda[Color DEFAULT]!I avoided the guards...Swam through the moat...I was almost there when they
caught me!p

0x7019
I found a [Color RED]small drain hole [Color DEFAULT]on the
right side of the castle that I
thought I could sneak into, but I
got stuck there.

0x701A
Ahem! Hrrrm!This beard is my pride and joy!
Doesn't it look luxuriant, kid?!

0x701B
Ahem! Hrrrm!This beard is my pride and joy!
Doesn't it look luxuriant, kid?!What?!You're looking for the guy from
Lon Lon Ranch?Hmm, maybe...p

0x701C
I saw a [Color RED]guy with a shabby-looking
beard [Color DEFAULT]delivering some boxes to 
the castle.

0x701D
Do you know about the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Temple 
of Time [Color DEFAULT]that we have in the 
northeast part of town?p

0x701E
Legends say that the Temple of
Time is the entrance to the 
Sacred Realm...Did you know that?

0x701F
Wha-ha-ha! What a crazy guy!Can you believe this guy was 
crazy enough to try to sneak into
the castle to see [Color RED]Princess Zelda[Color DEFAULT]?p

0x7020
All because of this idiot, they've 
tightened security at the castle.
Wha-ha-hah!

0x7021
I made a lot of money!Maybe I should go look for
more things to sell!p

0x7022
I know! I should go to [Color BLUE]Lake Hylia[Color DEFAULT]!
Many things float down the river
and end up there!
Hah hah!

0x7023
Hey, forest boy! This is the [Color LIGHTBLUE]city
of Hyrule[Color DEFAULT]! Take your time and
enjoy the sights!p

0x7024
If you came here to see [Color LIGHTBLUE]Hyrule
Castle[Color DEFAULT], take the street on your
right.If you want to see the [Color BLUE]back 
alleys[Color DEFAULT] of the town, take the
street to the left.

0x7025
Ohh...You are...so handsome...Just like the King of Hyrule...Hee hee...

0x7026
Ohh...You are...more beautiful...than Princess Zelda...Ohh...

0x7027
Have you heard the legend of the
"Shadow Folk"?They are the [Color BLUE]Sheikah[Color DEFAULT]...the shadows
of the Hylians.They say they swore allegiance to
the King of Hyrule and guarded
the Royal Family.But with the long peace, no one
has seen a Sheikah around here 
for a long time.However...p

0x7028
I heard there is one [Color BLUE]Sheikah 
[Color DEFAULT]woman living in the castle...

0x7029
So you say you want to see
[Color RED]Princess Zelda[Color DEFAULT], eh?You probably heard about her in
town and decided you had to meet
her... Well...Go home! Get out of here!
The Princess would never grant an
audience to the likes of you!

0x702A
Z Z Z Z Z....Mumble mumble...Welcome...our ranch is so fun...C'mon and look around...

0x702B
What in tarnation?Can't a person get a little shut-
eye around here?

0x702C
Hello, and who might you be?Yep, I'm [Color RED]Talon[Color DEFAULT], the owner of Lon 
Lon Ranch.I went to the castle to deliver
some milk, but I sat down here to
rest, and I guess I fell asleep...What?!
Malon was looking for me?
I'm gonna catch it from her now!I messed up bad, leaving Malon
behind to wait for me!She's really gonna let me have it!

0x702D
Hey you! Stop!
You, kid, over there!

0x702E
!Who?!

0x702F
Who are you?How did you get past the guards?

0x7030
Do you have it? 

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x7031
Well, that's odd...
I thought you might be the one
from my dream...
You really don't have it?Tell me the truth...

0x7032
Just as I thought!

0x7033
Please keep this a secret from
everyone...
[Color ADJUSTABLE]OK
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x7034
C'mon...don't be a blabber-mouth!

0x7035
The legend goes like this...

0x7036
The three goddesses hid the
[Color RED]Triforce [Color DEFAULT]containing the power of
the gods somewhere in Hyrule.The power
to grant the wish of the one who
holds the Triforce in his hands.If someone with a righteous heart
makes a wish, it will lead Hyrule
to a golden age of prosperity....If someone with an evil mind has
his wish granted, the world will
be consumed by evil...That is what
has been told....So, the ancient Sages built
the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Temple of Time[Color DEFAULT] to protect the
Triforce from evil ones.

0x7037
That's right... The Temple of Time
is the entrance through which you
can enter the Sacred Realm from
our world.But the entrance is sealed with
a stone wall called the 
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Door of Time[Color DEFAULT].And, in order to open the door,
it is said that you need to collect
three [Color RED]Spiritual Stones[Color DEFAULT].And another thing you need...is
the treasure that the Royal Family
keeps along with this legend...

0x7038
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I'm not very good at storytelling...

0x7039
What happened? Did he see you?Don't worry.He doesn't have any idea what
we're planning...yet!

0x703A
Please!

[Color ADJUSTABLE]OK
I don't believe you.[Color DEFAULT]

0x703B
Thank you!

0x703C
My attendant will guide you out of
the castle. Don't be afraid to talk
to her.

0x703D
The Spiritual Stone...
You finally found it!It is said that the races that hold
the Spiritual Stones open their
minds only to one who knows the
[Color BLUE]melody of the Royal Family[Color DEFAULT].But you already know that, don't
you?

0x703E
Hey, have you heard that
Princess Zelda sees prophetic 
visions in her dreams?

0x703F
Huh? What? Shoo, kid! Shoo!

0x7040
There are three hollows and 
an inscription here....Ye who owns 3 Spiritual Stones [Color BLUE]
[Color DEFAULT]Stand with the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Ocarina of Time[Color BLUE]
[Color DEFAULT]And play the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Song of Time[Color DEFAULT]That is how the inscription reads.

0x7041
C'mon, can't you make it any
cheaper?

0x7042
Hey, let go! It's mine!
I found it first!

0x7043
Hey, who bumped me?!

0x7044
We don't see a lot of Gerudos in
these parts...
Something fishy is going on!

0x7045
Wasn't that Princess Zelda riding
on the white horse?!

0x7046
I almost got kicked by that
black horse!

0x7047
That guy riding on the black horse
must have been Ganondorf, who is
renowned as the Gerudo King of 
Thieves.

0x7048
What happened?!

0x7049
Look at that guy--he's so scared!
What a wimp!
Ha ha hah!

0x704A
I have a feeling something
terrible is going to happen...
Maybe I should leave town soon.

0x704B
Something happened in the castle!
Kid, you'd better be careful!

0x704C
With that [Color RED]key[Color DEFAULT], proceed to the 
room ahead. Go, go!

0x704D
The one riding on the white horse
holding the little girl...
Wasn't that a legendary Sheikah?

0x704E
...Wake up...
, the chosen one...

0x704F
I am [Color RED]Rauru[Color DEFAULT], one of the ancient
Sages...Ages ago, we ancient Sages
built the Temple of Time to 
protect the entrance to the
Sacred Realm...This is the [Color RED]Chamber of Sages[Color DEFAULT],[Color RED] 
[Color DEFAULT]inside the Temple of Light...The Temple of Light, situated in
the very center of the Sacred 
Realm, is the last stronghold 
against Ganondorf's evil forces.The [Color RED]Master Sword[Color DEFAULT]--the evil-
destroying sword that you pulled
out of the Pedestal of Time--was 
the final key to the Sacred Realm....
Don't be alarmed...
Look at yourself...!

0x7050
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Look !
[Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]You're big now!!
[Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]You've grown up![Color DEFAULT]

0x7051
The Master Sword is a sacred
blade which evil ones may never
touch....Only one worthy of the title of
"[Color RED]Hero of Time[Color DEFAULT]"[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]can pull it from 
the Pedestal of Time....However, you were too young to 
be the Hero of Time....Therefore, your spirit was 
sealed here for seven years.And now that you are old enough,
the time has come for you to
awaken[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]as the Hero of Time!Well, do you understand your 
destiny?
[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x7052
Right, it looks like you are 
confused... Let me tell you 
again, from the beginning.p

0x7053
But, remember...Though you opened the Door of 
Time in the name of peace...[Color RED]Ganondorf[Color DEFAULT], the Gerudo King of
Thieves, used it to enter this 
forbidden Sacred Realm!He obtained the Triforce from
the Temple of Light, and with its 
power, he became the [Color RED]King of Evil[Color DEFAULT]...His evil power radiated from the
temples of Hyrule, and in seven
short years, it transformed Hyrule
into a world of monsters.My power now has only little 
influence, even in this Sacred
Realm...Namely, this Chamber of Sages.But there is still hope...The power of the Sages remains.When the power of all the [Color RED]Sages
[Color DEFAULT]is awakened...The [Color RED]Sages' Seals[Color DEFAULT] will contain
all the evil power in the void of 
the Realm...I, Rauru, am one of the Sages...
And...Your power to fight together with
the Sages makes you the 
[Color RED]Hero of Time[Color DEFAULT]!The Hero of Time, chosen by the
Master Sword!Keep my spirit with you...
And, find the power of the other
Sages and add their might to your
own!

0x7054
[Color LIGHTBLUE]...we're back in the
[Color DEFAULT]Temple of Time[Color LIGHTBLUE]...
But have [Color DEFAULT]seven years[Color LIGHTBLUE] really
passed?[Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]It looks like you won't be
able to use some of the [Color DEFAULT]weapons[Color LIGHTBLUE]
you found as a kid anymore...[Color DEFAULT][Color LIGHTBLUE]Let's get out of here![Color DEFAULT]

0x7055
Heyyy, what...? 
What's wrong with loitering
around all day?Huh, kid?

0x7056
I've been waiting for you, 
Hero of Time...

0x7057
When evil rules all, an awakening
voice from the Sacred Realm will
call those destined to be Sages,
who dwell in the [Color RED]five temples[Color DEFAULT].One in a [Color ADJUSTABLE]deep forest[Color DEFAULT]...One on a [Color RED]high mountain[Color DEFAULT]...One under a [Color BLUE]vast lake[Color DEFAULT]...One within the [Color PURPLE]house of the dead[Color DEFAULT]...One inside a [Color YELLOW]goddess of the sand[Color DEFAULT]...Together with the Hero of Time, 
the awakened ones will bind the
evil and return the light of peace
to the world...This is the legend of the temples
passed down by my people, the
[Color BLUE]Sheikah[Color DEFAULT].

0x7058
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're not open for business yet.
Please come back soon!

0x7059
Use the [Color RED]Master Sword[Color DEFAULT]!
Destroy Ganon with the sacred
sword!

0x705A
I have been waiting for you,
.

0x705B
, the Hero of Time...You have overcome many 
hardships and awakened six Sages.And now you have a final
challenge, a showdown with 
Ganondorf, the King of Evil....

0x705C
If you would seek the sacred
triangle, listen well...The resting place of the sacred
triangle, the Sacred Realm, is a
mirror that reflects what is
in the heart...the heart of one who enters it...
If an evil heart, the Realm will
become full of evil; if pure,
the Realm will become a paradise.The Triforce...the sacred triangle...
it is a balance that weighs the
three forces:
Power, Wisdom and Courage.If the heart of the one who holds
the sacred triangle has all three
forces in balance, that one will
gain the True Force to govern all.But, if that one's heart is not in
balance, the Triforce will separate
into three parts:
Power, Wisdom and Courage.Only one part will remain for the
one who touched the Triforce...the
part representing the force that
one most believes in.If that one seeks the True Force,
that one must acquire the two
lost parts.Those two parts will be held
within others chosen by destiny,
who will bear the Triforce mark
on the backs of their hands.

0x705D
Seven years ago, Ganondorf, the 
King of Thieves, used the door 
you opened in the Temple of Time
and entered the Sacred Realm.But when he laid his hands on the
Triforce, the legend came true.

0x705E
The one who holds the [Color RED]Triforce 
of Courage [Color DEFAULT]is...
You, !

0x705F
And the other, who holds the 
[Color RED]Triforce of Wisdom[Color DEFAULT]...is the seventh Sage, who is
destined to be the leader of
them all...

0x7060
It is I, the Princess of Hyrule,
[Color RED]Zelda[Color DEFAULT].

0x7061
I apologize for meeting you in 
disguise, but it was necessary to
hide from the King of Evil. 
Please forgive me...

0x7062
I saw you as I was escaping 
from the castle with my 
attendant, Impa.

0x7063
As long as you had the Ocarina 
in your possession, I thought 
Ganondorf could never enter the
Sacred Realm, but...something I could never expect
happened...

0x7064
That rumbling...It can't be!?

0x7065
Princess Zelda...you foolish 
traitor!I commend you for avoiding my 
pursuit for seven long years.

0x7066
If you want to rescue Zelda,
come to my castle!

0x7067
...can you hear me?
It's Rauru, the Sage.We six will gather our power to
create a bridge to the castle
where Ganondorf dwells...The castle's keep, which is 
known as Ganon's Tower, is 
protected by [Color RED]six evil barriers[Color DEFAULT].Bring down the six barriers and
save Princess Zelda!!

Ancient Creators of Hyrule!Now, open the sealed door
and send the Evil Incarnation of
Darkness into the void of the
Evil Realm!!

0x706D
!
Finish him off with the sword of
time, the Master Sword!

0x706E
Oh sealed door opened by the 
Sages... Close forever with 
the Evil Incarnation of Darkness
within!!

0x706F
Thank you, ...Thanks to you, Ganondorf has
been sealed inside the Evil Realm!Thus, peace will once again
reign in this world...for a time.

0x7070
Thank you...
...Good-bye....

0x7071
Do you really want to go through
this gate that much? Let me think
about it... OK, but in return...p

0x7072
Give me 10 Rupees...

[Color ADJUSTABLE]Yes
No[Color DEFAULT]

0x7073
Please believe me....
My prophecies have never been
wrong!

0x7074
You destroyed the wicked
creatures that haunted the temple
and awakened the Sage...But there are still other Sages
who need your help.In order to awaken all the other
Sages, you must become even
more powerful.You must travel over
mountains...under water...and even through time...

0x7075
As long as you hold the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Ocarina
of Time[Color DEFAULT] and the [Color LIGHTBLUE]Master Sword[Color DEFAULT],you hold time itself in your
hands..., we shall meet 
again!

0x7076
This is a new type of bomb!
It's available only in limited
quantities, and when I'm sold 
out, that's it!

0x7077
I am [Color RED]Sheik[Color DEFAULT].
Survivor of the Sheikahs...

0x7078
As I see you standing there
holding the mythical [Color RED]Master 
Sword[Color DEFAULT], you really do look like the 
legendary Hero of Time...

0x7079
If you believe the legend, you
have no choice. You must look for
the five temples and awaken the
[Color RED]five Sages[Color DEFAULT]....

0x707A
One Sage is waiting for the time
of awakening in the [Color ADJUSTABLE]Forest Temple[Color DEFAULT].
The Sage is a girl I am sure you
know...Because of the evil power in the
temple, she cannot hear the
awakening call from the Sacred
Realm...Unfortunately, equipped as you 
currently are, you cannot even
enter the temple...But, if you believe what I'm saying,
you should head to [Color RED]Kakariko 
Village[Color DEFAULT]...Do you understand, 
?

0x707B
I thought I should entrust the
Ocarina to you... I thought that 
would be our best chance...

0x707C
Before that...I have things I want 
to tell only to you. Please listen.Another unknown legend of the 
Triforce passed down by the 
shadow folk, the Sheikahs....

0x707D
The Triforce separated into three 
parts. Only the [Color RED]Triforce of Power[Color DEFAULT]
remained in Ganondorf's hand.

0x707E
The strength of the Triforce of
Power enabled him to become a
mighty, evil king, but his dark
ambitions were not satisfied.

0x707F
To gain complete mastery of the 
world, Ganondorf started looking
for [Color RED]those chosen by destiny[Color DEFAULT] to 
hold the two other Triforce parts.

0x7080
On that day, seven years ago,
Ganondorf attacked Hyrule Castle.

0x7081
After you opened the door of 
time, the Master Sword sealed you
away in the Sacred Realm...

0x7082
Your spirit remained in the Sacred
Realm...and then the Triforce fell 
into Ganondorf's hands. He went
on to invade the Sacred Realm...Ganondorf had become the Evil
King, and the Sacred Realm
became a world of evil. All of
this is an unfortunate coincidence.I passed myself off as a Sheikah
and hoped that you would return.
I waited for seven years...

0x7083
And...now you are back. The 
dark age ruled by Ganondorf the
Evil King will end!

0x7084
The six Sages will open the sealed
door and lure Ganondorf back into
the Sacred Realm.I will then seal the door to the 
Sacred Realm from this world.Thus, Ganondorf the Evil King will
vanish from Hyrule....
In order to do this, I need your 
courage again. Please protect me
while I do my part.And here is a weapon that can 
penetrate the Evil King's defenses...
The power given to the chosen 
ones...The sacred [Color LIGHTBLUE]Arrow of Light[Color DEFAULT]!!!

0x7085
But you let your guard down...
I knew you would appear if I let
this kid wander around!

0x7086
My only mistake was to slightly
underestimate the power of this
kid...

0x7087
No...
It was not the kid's power I
misjudged, it was the power of
the Triforce of Courage!But, with the Triforce of Wisdom
that Zelda has...
When I obtain these two Triforces...Then, I will become the true
ruler of the world!!

0x7088
The Ocarina of Time opened the
door. The Hero of Time, with the
Master Sword, descended here.

0x7089
It seems strange that packs of
dogs roam our streets at night...
Doesn't that seem weird to you?

0x708A
Hey, sonny, I'll tell you something
helpful...I heard there is a [Color RED]mysterious 
fountain[Color DEFAULT] somewhere near the 
castle...

0x708B
If you want to return to your
original time, return the Master 
Sword to the [Color RED]Pedestal of Time[Color DEFAULT].By doing this, you will travel back
in time seven years....

0x708C
The time will come when you will
have to return here quickly...
I will teach this to you for when 
that time comes...The song to return you to the 
Temple of Time...
[Color LIGHTBLUE]The Prelude of Light[Color DEFAULT]...

0x708D
I am [Color RED]Impa [Color DEFAULT]of the Sheikahs.
I am responsible for protecting
Princess Zelda. Everything is 
exactly as the Princess foretold.

0x708E
If the castle soldiers find you,
there will be trouble. Let me 
lead you out of the castle.

0x708F
Hey you! Don't cause any trouble!

0x7090
You are a courageous boy...
You are heading out on a big, new 
adventure, aren't you?My role in the Princess's dream
was to teach a melody[Color RED] [Color DEFAULT]to the one
from the forest.This is an ancient [Color BLUE]melody passed 
down by the Royal Family[Color DEFAULT].I have played this song for 
Princess Zelda as a lullaby ever
since she was a baby...There is mysterious power in 
these notes.Now listen carefully...

0x7091
All the tragedy that has befallen
Hyrule was my doing...I was so young...I could not
comprehend the consequences of 
trying to control the Sacred Realm.I dragged you into it, too.Now it is time for me to make up 
for my mistakes...You must lay the Master Sword to 
rest and close the Door of Time...

0x7092
However, by doing this, the road
between times will be closed...

0x7093
,
give the Ocarina to me...As a Sage, I can return you
to your original time with it.

0x7094
When peace returns to Hyrule...It will be time for us to say 
good-bye...

0x7095
Now, go home, .
Regain your lost time!Home... 
where you are supposed to be...
the way you are supposed to be...

0x7096
Tsk Tsk.

0x7097
Well, maybe that's too much
for a kid to pay.

0x7098
OK, I'll let you pass,
quickly!

0x7099
KEEP IT A SECRET 
FROM EVERYONE.

0x709A
Man, I am SO tired!The night watch is so boring!
I wish some ghosts would come 
out or something...Hey, I'm really interested in 
ghosts!Studying them is a hobby of mine,
but you never know...the time
might come when that kind of
knowledge might be useful!

0x709B
My precious little puppy's fur coat
is very special compared to the 
other mutts around here!

0x709C
My precious puppy can run faster
than any of the other mutts
around here!

0x709D
I can't find my puppy anywhere!
I need you to look for it! Please!

0x709E
Arrrgh!
That is not my dog! 
How could you mix up my puppy
with a mutt like that?!

0x709F
Richard!This is my little Richard!
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll give this to you as a
reward!

0x70A0
At night it's dangerous to go out
with all the wild dogs around...
No, I wasn't warning you! 
I'm worried about my puppy!

Oh, you brought a Poe today!Hmmmm!Very interesting!
This is a [Color RED]Big Poe[Color DEFAULT]!I'll buy it for [Color RED]50 Rupees[Color DEFAULT].On top of that, I'll put [Color RED]100
points [Color DEFAULT]on your card.If you earn [Color RED]1,000 points[Color DEFAULT], you'll
be a happy man! Heh heh.

0x70F8
Wait a minute! WOW!You have earned [Color RED]1,000 points[Color DEFAULT]!Young man, you are a genuine
[Color RED]Ghost Hunter[Color DEFAULT]!Is that what you expected me to
say? Heh heh heh!Because of you, I have extra
inventory of [Color RED]Big Poes[Color DEFAULT], so this will
be the last time I can buy a 
ghost.You're thinking about what I 
promised would happen when you
earned 1,000 points. Heh heh.Don't worry, I didn't forget.
Just take this.

0x70F9
Oh? What's that?Is that...

0x70FA
[Color LIGHTBLUE]a fairy[Color DEFAULT]?!Then, are you...
Are you from the forest?

0x70FB
Then...then...you wouldn't happen to
have...the [Color ADJUSTABLE]Spiritual Stone of the 
Forest[Color DEFAULT], would you?! That green 
and shining stone...

0x70FC
I had a dream...In the dream,
dark storm clouds were billowing
over the land of Hyrule...But suddenly, a ray of light shot
out of the forest, parted the
clouds and lit up the ground...The light turned into a figure
holding a [Color ADJUSTABLE]green and shining stone[Color DEFAULT],
followed by a [Color LIGHTBLUE]fairy[Color DEFAULT]...

0x70FD
I know this is a prophecy that
someone would come from the
[Color ADJUSTABLE]forest[Color DEFAULT]...Yes, I thought you might
be the one...

0x70FE
Oh, I'm sorry!I got carried away with my story 
and didn't even properly introduce 
myself!

0x70FF
I am [Color LIGHTBLUE]Zelda[Color DEFAULT], Princess of Hyrule.

0x7100
What? Have we met before?

0x7101
Awww... That's so cute!
Could you tell me where you
found it?

0x7102
Yeeeah!
Help me!

0x7103
Uh...yeah? So what?

0x7104
I hate foxes!

0x7105
How irritating!

0x7106
Hey, you look good!

0x7107
YEEEAH! What's your problem?!

0x7108
Oooh...is that a Zora?
Those cool eyes are really
fascinating...

0x7109
Oh no! You're scary!
Don't come any closer!

0x710A
Wow...how nostalgic! That
reminds me of when I was a
little kid.

0x710B
That's kind of funny...it
makes me laugh!
Hee hee!

0x710C
Uh-oh! I'm sorry, mom!
Oh...hey, it's you!
Don't scare me like
that!

0x710D
What a big head you have!

0x710E
Oh, don't do that!
I'm shy...

0x710F
Is there a mask competition
going on? 
I'm going to vote for you!

0x7110
Oh! A rabbit!
Speaking of rabbits, I saw a 
strange man chasing rabbits 
around...

0x7111
Oooh, what a pretty lady!
But you're kind of short,
aren't you?

0x7112
Well...I can't think of anything
funny to say...sorry, kid!

0x7113
A mask... When I was a little 
kid, I also wore masks around...
What? You say you can't imagine
me doing that?

0x7114
Ohhhh...I see...
It's an illusion...

0x7115
Hey, kid, don't grow up to be
like me...

0x7116
AAAAAAAAAAAH!
A GERUDO!!!!Wha-? A mask?
Why do you have a mask 
like that?!

0x7117
Sorry, I'm busy right now.

0x7118
Oh wow! It's Keaton!
Hi, Keaton!

0x7119
How spooky!
There's a boy in Kakariko
Village who was looking for a
mask like that!

0x711A
Hmm...well...don't you have any
other masks?

0x711B
What a strange mask!
Hee hah haa!

0x711C
Hey kid! Can't you see we're
busy?! Leave us alone!

0x711D
I'm sorry. I don't even want to
look at any other woman!

0x711E
Hee hee.
Don't pay any attention to that
kid, my dear... Just pretend we're
in our own, private little world...

0x711F
Oh, please!
Go bother someone 
else!

0x7120
There's a rumor going around that
there is a Potion Shop that can
make the ultimate medicine!

0x7121
I heard a rumor that there is a 
monster that eats [Color LIGHTBLUE]Hylian Shields[Color DEFAULT]
somewhere out there in the world.
Have you ever seen it?

0x7122
I came here to sell bombs...
Please buy some!

0x7123
I...I am afraid...
I have a feeling that man is going
to destroy Hyrule.He has such terrifying power!But it's fortunate that you have 
come...

0x7124
What? If you want something,
just make it clear!

0x7125
I'm busy! Get out of my way,
you bum!

0x7126
Hey, you have some good,
quality wood there, kid!

0x7127
Hrrrrm!
Get out of my face!
You good for nothin'...

0x7128
EEEEEEAAAAH!
Whoops, I shouldn't scream like
that or the boss will yell at me!

0x7129
Oh, sorry boss! 
I didn't mean to slack off!
I'll get busy!Oh, that's not you, boss?

0x712A
Gerudos are beautiful and brave...
They are just so fascinating!

0x712B
Someday, when I have more skill,
I'll carve a mask like that one!

0x712C
Oh, that's the mask
everyone is talking about!
Looks kind of strange...

0x712D
Wa-ha-hah!
How's business,
Mr. Hero?
Hah hah hah!

0x712E
I'm on duty.
Understand?
ON DUTY!

0x712F
Hmm, well, I don't really know
what to say about that one...

0x7130
Oh wow! Cute!
But Cuccos are much cuter!

0x7131
Eh, what?
Are you sad?
Happy?
I really can't tell...

0x7132
I'm sorry, I'm not really
interested in that.

0x7133
The little kid playing in the
graveyard was saying something
about his face...

0x7134
I really am a good man.
Don't you believe me?

0x7135
WHAAAA--!
I thought you were that old hag!
Don't scare me like that!

0x7136
I remember my father talking
about a swordsmith...but that
doesn't really matter to me
anyway.

0x7137
I'm not afraid of any forest 
monsters! Are you trying to
make fun of me?

0x7138
What is that? I can't see it
very well from here...

0x7139
Hi again! How are you today?

0x713A
Everything's fine today!

0x713B
Tired...I'm so tired...

0x713C
I don't care about any
foxes!

0x713D
That's irritating!
It bothers my eyes!

0x713E
That looks quite handsome!

0x713F
Waaaaaaah!
What is wrong with you?
Do you have a bad attitude?

0x7140
You idiot! 
When you talk to someone, you
should make eye contact!

0x7141
You idiot!
When you talk to someone, you
shouldn't stare!

0x7142
You idiot!
When you talk to someone, you
should take off your mask!

0x7143
You idiot!
I don't know why I'm calling
you that, but...you are one!

0x7144
Where did you get that?
What?
It's a mask?

0x7145
Uh, leave me alone...
Can't you see I'm in a groove
right now?

0x7146
A mask is just like a musical 
instrument--it reflects the
character of its owner. I like
your originality, kid!

0x7147
What a big head!
How'd you fit through that door?!

0x7148
I HATE foxes, sonny!

0x7149
Now if that isn't the most
irritating face I've seen in
all my days, I don't know what
is!

0x714A
Hey, that's a fine face
you got there, sonny!

0x714B
Have you got any complaints?
Speak up, then!

0x714C
Please quit playing around
and dispel our curse!

0x714D
If I wore something like that...
I'd be a real Skulltula...
AAAAAAAAAAH!

0x714E
Please understand if I don't
laugh... It's hard to be happy
in this condition... 
Being cursed and all...

0x714F
Hyaaaaah!
That's scary!
I know I'm scary, but...man!
That's really scary!

0x7150
Huh?! Wha--!Oh, it's just a kid.
Don't scare me like that!
I may not look like it, but I'm a
very sensitive guy!

0x7151
Well, will you lookit the noggin on 
this kid! It's HUGE!
Mine is huge too, though...

0x7152
Do you know what kind of
mask you're wearing...?
And you're still wearing it?

0x7153
I'm on duty now... 
If you want me to dig, don't
bother me.

0x7154
What is that? It's something
that hops around in a field...
I forgot what those things are
called...

0x7155
Hey! It's a Keaton Mask!!
I asked my daddy to get me one,
too!

0x7156
That's not very different from
Mr. Damp, is it?

0x7157
That doesn't look anything like
Mr. Damp, huh?

0x7158
Hey, cool mask...but a little
scary, don't you think?

0x7159
Hey! That looks familiar...
I think I saw something like it
in the Lost Woods, no?

0x715A
That makes me feel...happy...

0x715B
Oh...uh...sniff...
That mask...
It makes me feel...sad...

0x715C
Hah! That mask won't do you any
good! You're just afraid of me,
the great Mido...aren't you?!

0x715D
Waaaaah! What?
Hey, I'm not scared of you!
Just don't come any closer,
understand?!

0x715E
Hey, that's a cool mask.
I want it!
JUST KIDDING! Hah!
I don't want that stupid mask!

0x715F
Wah hah ha hah!
That really suits you!

0x7160
Waaaah!
I-I'm gonna tell Mido about 
this!

0x7161
Yeeeeah!
I-I'm gonna tell Mido to beat
you up!

0x7162
Whooooah!
Are you some kind of forest
ghost?

0x7163
That's so cool!
Uh...don't tell Mido I said that!

0x7164
What?!
You came back!
I can tell who you are, even
with that mask on!

0x7165
I wonder what Mido would say if
he saw that?
I really would like to see his
reaction!

0x7166
I see...
You're going to scare Mido with
that mask, aren't you?!

0x7167
Hah hah hah!
What a funny face!
I bet Saria would think it's
pretty funny, too!

0x7168
Tee hee hee!
A mask made of wood?
It looks like you're wearing
a shield on your face!

0x7169
What a weird face!Speaking of weird faces, one of
the forest kids was complaining
about his face...

0x716A
What an enormous head you have!

0x716B
Tee hee!
Where did you get that?
Outside the forest?
No way! I don't believe it!

0x716C
Hee hee!
Kind of funny, but it's not
really my style...

0x716D
Right on! 
Wearing this mask makes me feel
really tough and scary!
Hee hee!

0x716E
Hee hee!
There sure are a lot of different
people in the world!

0x716F
Hee hee!
I don't need a new one...
I like the one I have, thanks!

0x7170
Wow, that makes your head
look huge!
Hee hee!

0x7171
What a cute little mouse!
What?
Oh, it's not a mouse?

0x7172
What are those floppy things
on your head?
Ears? That mask makes you look
like you have four ears!

0x7173
It must be exciting to sneak
past the guards while wearing
that mask!

0x7174
Hi, fairy boy!
What?
You think you're in disguise?
But it's so obvious who you are!

0x7175
Wow!
What big eyes you have!
Gorons are so cute, aren't they!

0x7176
Oh, I know that character!
It's Keaton!
He's very hot in Hyrule Castle
Town right now!

0x7177
Oh, brother!
Boys will be boys!

0x7178
Wait...wait...
I know who ya are...
Yer... Kin-ton!
Ain't that right?!

0x7179
That's a scary one, ain't it?
Almost as scary as...Ingo!

0x717A
Hey, that reminds me of my wife...
On second thought, it doesn't...
It doesn't look like her at all!

0x717B
YAAAWWN...
I'm kinda tired right now...
Show it to me later...

0x717C
Scram, kid!
Can't you see I'm busy?!

0x717D
Humph!
It's fine to play like that when 
you're a kid, but just wait until
you grow up! Work, work, work!

0x717E
YEOW!
Humph. It's just a mask...
Scram, kid! Get out of here!

0x717F
Heh heh heh...
Well, that cheered me up a little,
kid.
Thanks!

0x7180
Hmmm... Let's see...
Yes, I'm quite sure of it...
That was manufactured from a 
plank from a coffin. Yes, it was!

0x7181
Ahhh...yes. Let's see...
Very fine craftsmanship.
But I don't think it would make
a good ingredient for my medicine.

0x7182
Very interesting! A Goron!
Speaking of Gorons, I wonder
how my old friend, Biggoron of
Death Mountain, is doing?

0x7183
Very unusual construction...
I don't think it's water soluble,
so it wouldn't make a good 
ingredient for my medicines...

0x7184
Chomp chomp chomp...
OK, OK, a mask.
Do you want to buy some beans?

0x7185
Chomp chomp chomp...
Nope, I don't want to buy it.

0x7186
Chomp chomp chomp...
Nope, it's not my style.

0x7187
Chomp chomp chomp...
Well...no, I don't think I 
want it.

0x7188
What do you want?

0x7189
You don't look like you can
swim very well...

0x718A
Red hair...tan skin...
I've seen people like that before...

0x718B
Yeah, right.
You look a little small for a
Zora...

0x718C
Ho ho ho!
You Hylians...you are such silly
creatures!

0x718D
That face...it gives me the chills...

0x718E
Talk about a nostalgia trip!
That reminds me of my childhood
friend, Biggoron!

0x718F
I don't think that's funny at all.
Are you mocking me?

0x7190
You're a funny guy!

0x7191
Your head--it's gigantic!

0x7192
Don't do that...
It's embarrassing me!

0x7193
All right! You actually decided
to become a Zora!
Are you actually ready to marry
me now?

0x7194
WHOA!
My heart...started to beat 
so fast!

0x7195
That's an unpleasant mask...
Good-bye.

0x7196
Hrrrrm...
I don't know what to say.

0x7197
You shouldn't be so picky about
what you eat! Do you eat all your
green rocks? If you don't, you 
won't grow up big and strong!

0x7198
Leave me alone!

0x7199
Are you trying to make me laugh?
Well, that's not that funny...

0x719A
You're making me mad!

0x719B
I hate Gerudos!!

0x719C
Quit pestering me!
Go away!

0x719D
Wah hah hah!
Do you think you're in disguise?
How funny!

0x719E
Out of my way!
Get out of here!
You're asking for it, aren't you?

0x719F
Hey, kid, you've got guts coming
around here wearing that!
Still, you can't fool us that
easily!

0x71A0
What is that?
What does it have to do with
us?

0x71A1
Ha ha hah!
You've got guts to spare, don't
you kid? 
I like you!

0x71A2
C'mon! It's time to get serious!

0x71A3
That's odd...it kind of looks like
me...
No...not really.  Not at all,
if you look at it closely.

0x71A4
Hmm. No, no, no!
The ears aren't right at all!
They should be, you know, longer!

0x71A5
Aren't you kind of scared, 
walking around in the middle of
the night looking like that?

0x71A6
Ha ha hah!
You really like those things,
don't you?!

0x71A7
I think I've seen a stone that
looks like that somewhere...
Now where was that?
Hmmmm....

0x71A8
Hurry up, !
Any second now, the tower is 
going to collapse!!

0x71A9
Watch out for falling rubble!

0x71AA
!
Help me!

0x71AB
!
The exit is just over there!

0x71AC
Thank you, .
Now, let's hurry!

0x71AD
Too bad!Practice hard and come back!

0x71AE
Almost!!Well...all right!
I'll let you try one more time for
free...
This time, you gotta do it!

0x71AF
Wonderful!!!
Bravo!!!
Perfect!!!Here's a fantastic present!

0x71B0
[Color LIGHTBLUE]Oh, no! [Color RED]Time's up!
[Color LIGHTBLUE]The thing you were going to 
deliver has spoiled!
Let's try again![Color DEFAULT]

0x71B1
BOINNG! BOINNG!
The current time is: !

0x71B2
You heard about us from the
guard at Death Mountain gate?
Well, I have to give
you a good deal then!
